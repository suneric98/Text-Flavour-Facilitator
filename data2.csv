Quick PSA,"Quick PSA,

If you deny the fact that Kanye has literally shaped the current state of hip hop and most music both directly and indirectly and that he makes inferior music now, you know nothing about how music works nor industry history. Kanye will one day be remembered as one of, if not the greatest artist of our generation. He introduced singing into hip hop when it was considered uncool, brought back the 808's drum machine, has produced some of the greatest artistic works of all time, has affected every single artist working currently in some way, and continues to evolve and create wonderful works of art that anyone can love if they are open to it.

Anyways, that's my rant for today ❤️"
I’m from Texas,"I’m from the state of Texas

YEEHAW🤠i tell you what, I’m from the state of texas🇺🇸MY MEEMAW👱🏿‍♀️MAKES THE BEST DAMN BISCUITS AND GRAVY🍜 I TAKE A HORSE 🐎 TO WORK EVERY DAY AND I LIVE ON A FARM🏚I HAVE A 44. GAUGE ON MY BACK🔫 SO DONT YOU FUCKING FUCK WITH ME YOU FUCKTARD!"
From r/unpopularopinion," 

# I hate ""doggo"" speak so much it makes my blood emerge from my body and take on the form of a demon.

📷

Honestly I hate this sub, but I needed to get this out. I hate the ""doggo woofer pupper"" shit *so fucking much it's insane*. I see it and I feel like flying into a Satanic rage. It's *so stupid* and I don't understand why grown adults want to speak like literal toddlers.

Every god damn Askreddit thread that says ""What's something that the opposite gender does that's a turn off"", people are all like ""hnnn I hate baby talk it's sooooo gross brrrrr"" and then turn around and spew shit like ""awww lookit the FLOOFER DOGGO BOYO doin a HECKIN TAIL WAG i wanna BOOP THE SNOOT haha HENLO FREN"". Holy shit it makes me want to stab something.

It's just the same old ""LUL i'm SO R4ND0M!!!"" and ""I can haz cheezeburger??"" that people laugh at now *even though it's exactly as fucking cringey as this doggo shit*. I fucking guarantee you in 2 years people will look back and go ""what the fuck were we thinking, speaking like toddlers that had their head bashed in with a hammer?""

Fuck, I swear to god whenever I see this stupid hivemind unoriginal bullshit I turn into a fucking black hole. SPEAK LIKE AN ACTUAL HUMAN ADULT. GOD DAMNIT I'M SO MAD I'M FUCKING MELTING. FUCK HELP ME I'M SHRINKING, FUCK, NO, HELP, I'M SHRINKING, I'M SHRINKING FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK"

🗿,"🗿Say Jimbo, do you believe in entropy?🗿

🗿did you know that under ideal conditions, in a void, atoms can rearrange themselves randomly?🗿

🗿you see, entropy dictates that these particles can and WILL rearrange themselves in all forms possible🗿

🗿they can form a perfect sphere given enough time🗿

🗿or even a fully functioning human brain... complete with memories, feelings and and all the neural connections needed for it to be considered alive...🗿

🗿it is not only possible, but unavoidable🗿

🗿wouldn’t that be funny, jimbo?🗿

🗿you could be a brain floating in void right now, relieving its entire history only to be unmade seconds from now 🗿

Found in a Belle Delphine comment section,All jokes aside about belle. She is an amazing person. She doesn't deserve the hate she gets. She is very misunderstood and I wish people had more respect for her. She is a queen to me and she is the cutest person I've seen. I hope you notice me Belle. The people who hate you are just jealous of you The people who hate you don't matter. You matter a lot to me belle. I was really sad to see your Instagram being deleted. I hope you can get your Instagram account back and maybe you might post more on your channel. I have lots of love for you❤️

Only intellectuals are capable of liking death stranding,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Death Stranding. The fun is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Timefall physics most of the entertainment will go over a typical gamer's head. There's also Norman Reedus's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Death Stranding truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the product placement in Norman's existencial catchphrase ""Unleash the Beast,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to American consumerism. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Hideo Kojima's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a fetus tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand."

dude i went to a community pool yesterday right,"dude i went to a community pool yesterday right and i forgot my key so i hop the side fence with my buddy. when i walked down the steps i overheard yelling across the way. naturally we approached the source and saw two kids fighting in the pool. at first we thought boys will be boys and jt was just a bit of old fashioned fun but thats when it hit us. they weren’t making any noise at all, just splashing around playing. it puzzled us but we proceeded to climb up to the spa area for some relaxation. but there would be no relaxation on that day. our heads violently turned as we heard violent yelling and berating coming from none other than chris, who was proceeding to harass these two poor mentally handicapped children calling them a slew of disability slurs and insults. i was taken aback at first but realized i had to take action. i immediately got out of the pool and proceeded to use my sociology degree to explain to chris that it is wrong to bully other minorities and that everyone is equal. he started crying and apologized and then j was carried off on a chair. one less bigot in the world, 7 billion to go 😎"

Thanks r/buildapcforme,"My PC was pissed on last night, please help 👋

This story is so unbelievable 🙄 I’m still processing it but long 🍆 story short my roommate 🏠 came from the bars 🍺 last night and brought his girl 👧 with him. She came into my room 🛌 at 5am 🕰 thinking it was the bathroom 🚽 , sat on my computer 💻 and started peeing. I have opening vents at the top  so the urine 💦 dropped down into my computer 💻 and the MOBO 🤓 and GPU. 🤓 (It’s the Meshify C case 💼 if you 🤠 were wondering). I opened it up immediately and dried 🌵 it down with a towel. the GPU, the MOBO, and everything else I found the liquid 💧 on. Right now it’s drying next to the window pointed at the sub🌞. How long 🍆 should I wait to test it? Is there anything else I can do to hopefully preserve it? I’m hesitant to unplug cables and take out the parts because it’s been 4 months 📆 since I built it 🏗 and all my PC building skills are nonexistent, completely. Please 🙌 let me know if there’s anything I can do, thank you.
updated. thank you so much for the advice."

Jungle Jim's,"Hey guys now that the 🤪shenanigans🤪 of that video are over, lets get to the actual gluten-free🍞🍞 portion. So, as you may or may not know and was shown in the video, 🐒Jungle Jim's🐒 has the larges gluten-free🍞🍞 selection in the Midwest,as well as having a large selection of pretty much anything. Uhhhhhhhhh, they have anything from gluten-free potstickers🥢🥢🥢 to against the grain pizza🌲🌳🎄, which I personally believed to be the best gluten-free frozen pizza. They also have a wide variety of flour🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼, mixes, pastas, basically anything that you can eat. Chicken nuggets, fries, they have it all. If you want the 😤GO TO PLACE😤 for gluten-free at reasonable prices then Jungle Jim's is the place to go due to their large selection. If you ever get a chance to go out and visit Jungle Jim's feel free💲💲, you can get all kinds of crazy 🥩meats🥩, all kinds of crazy cheeses🧀, obviously they have a MASSIVE variety of gluten-free foods, its kind of a shoppers paradise. Just be careful to budget yourself, and ♿tr-tr-try♿ to stick to that budget. It can be difficult with all the different things that will be thrown in your face. I probably shouldn't of 💲💲splurged💲💲 on that many dumplings or the gluten free cheesecake like I did... but it'S DEFINETLY a good idea to stay within your budget. Also Jungle Jim's has two locations the one where we shot the 🎥🎥🎥video the 🗑️Eastgate🗑️ location, as well as one in Fairfield, 🗑️Ohio🗑️. This provides you with a couple options in case you want to plan your trip accordingly. Thank you all for watching, please feel free to like, comment, and subscribe. And as always enjoy."

The big secret,"Exposing myself

I, cummybot😳, have decided to come out clean 🙈 ..... I really did 9/11 😔 I cause those planes ✈️🛩🛬 to crash into those two towers 🏬🏬 and I have no regrets 😎. I’ll do it again when you less expect it 🥳 and frame it on Donald trump 🤭 don’t tell anyone though 🤫🤫 or I’ll bomb you 💣💣 and say it was suicide"
"How original, another comment about fricking cummy.","Wow, you’re so original 🤮🤮🤢. You must be the only person in the history of this subreddit (a smaller category of Reddit) to do that. You must be so intelligent, and we bow down to you as a god. How inspirational that you want to do a robot. You’re like the weebs but worse. If Hitler was in a room with you and Winston Churchill he would take one look at you and shove the gun so far down your throat that Gordon Ramsey would make him an iron chef once Hitler finished shooting your stomach out. You are a repulsive excuse for a human being and I hope a second holocaust starts, but only to kill you. I mean really, you hurt me on a personal level.


What can you do moving forward?

Easy: all you have to do is leave this subreddit forever. If I do much as find you on here again I’m going to shove a circuit board up your ass so you can finally do cummy like you’ve always wanted to. HE’S A ROBOT. YOU NEED TO STOP!!! 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑. It’s not that hard. 

What else will happen if I don’t stop?

WHY DONT YOU ASK THE MODERATOR. MABY IF THEY MADE ME A MODERATOR I COULD ANSWER YOUR QUESTION.

"WA, I think you chose the wrong asshole🥴😩💋","WA, I think you chose the wrong asshole🥴😩💋"
I love corporations (don't ask questions just consume product and get excited for next product)," I love corporations SO MUCH. I especially love when large, billion dollar companies say they care about the environment because it's SO GENUINE! When I go to bed at night, Bill Gates brings me up a warm glass of milk and cookies and tucks me into bed! Because he cares about me. Then when I wake up the next morning, Jeff Besos is always there, smiling at me and pushing me to get up and do my daily work! Because HE CARES ABOUT ME!!! Then, at the end of the day, guess who's back from the grave - it's Steve Jobs! And what's this?!?! He's giving me one of his patented Steve blowjobs!!!!!!!! Because - you guessed it - HE CARES ABOUT ME!!!  

So I hope you take this lesson to heart and realise that CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE TOO (Mitt Romney said this, look it up!). So the next time you think you can just say that corporations are ""destroying the environment"" or that they're ""underpaying their workers"" or even ""violating human rights"" just remember my story! LOVE CORPORATIONS AND THEIR PRODUCTS!   😊"

However, one person was intrigued in what I was saying.

""M-m-m-minecraft...""

Then it was just a domino effect, ten more people are watching.

""Minecraft...""

A hundred were now watching, this had caught the attention of even the busy drivers in rush hour. Their faces in anticipation, some were even scared. Others were complaining that this isn't the real deal.

""MINECRAFT...""

But they all suddenly started cheering, shaking, praying. When they heard my tone, my pitch, my timbre.... they all knew what was going to come next. They realized... that salvation of the human race has finally come.

""Minecraft good Fortnite bad""

And then the silence broke

""OOOIOIIUUUUUGHHHhJJHHHHHWAASEAAAa//::""

Thousands of people fell to their knees, yelling orgasmically. People starting crying tears of joy, others were running and thanking God, News reporters were already on the scene, broadcasting the entire thing nationwide and consequently the entire world. Hundreds of people came out of their cars, buses, taxis, stores, and subway stations hooting and hollering. It was a miracle unfolding.

I started to say the next sentence relayed to me by our Lord and Savior.

""M-m-mi... Mine...""

Already some people fainted at just the mere sound of my voice. Even more people came. Some were jumping from planes thousands of feet in the air, others ran or swam miles to here in mere seconds. I think I even spotted a few famous people.

""MINE...""

Nearly a million people were here now. There's now Europeans, Canadians, Mexicans, Latin Americans, West Coasters, Africans, and even several Asians and one Australian. They were screaming hysterically, bringing gifts for me, taking pictures and videos. Fireworks and confetti everywhere, helicopters, and even Donald Trump was here with his family bowing down to me.

""MINEC-C-C-CRAFT voice crack""

A billion people were here now. Even animals from all over the world were coming in herds. I could see Pewdiepie &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Martiza, Elon Musk, Keanu Reeves, Lil Nas X, 50 Cent, Oprah Winfrey, the Kardashians, and so many other people. Many people were having seizures, heart attacks, and strokes from the sheer excitement, and some were being trampled to death because of the huge crowd. The screaming was deafening. Some just came straight out of their bathroom, school, work, or their parenting... but it doesn't matter now.

""MMMMMMIIIIINNNNEEECRAAAFTTTTT""

No matter what was your race, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, economic class, etc... it didn't matter. All of humanity has come together for this one moment. Millions of people have died to due plane crashes, car crashes, doctors abandoning their patients, parents abandoning their children... just to be here, but it will all be worth it.

Nearly half of humanity is here now. Even the dead came out their graves for this. Everyone is climbing on top of each other and on the walls of skyscrapers since they couldn't fit. So many lights, music, dancing, feasts... yet barely a minute passed. Humanity is very interesting.

10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

I look at the smiling faces of the crowd in front of me. I look at the death and destruction that came from sacrifice to attend this event. This is it. We're ready.

0.

""Minecraft good Fortnite bad Instagram normie Emojis bad Keanu breathtaking Wholesome 100 [Everyone liked that] Area 51 PETA bad 69 nice 420""

""AaAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAyyyYYYYYYYYYYYyaYayaYaASyAAaYaaYayaAAAaaUGgGHHhHHhhHHhhHHh😩😩👅👄👀🥵🥵mmmmMMMMmMmMMMMMMMMM😭🤯😱😂🤣😍🤪💦hhhhhhHhFFFfffF""

Billions of people around the world disintegrated into their pure chemical compounds that composed their bodies, then their atoms, then their protons/neutrons/electrons, and finally their quarks... as they heard that holy sentence. The distant echoes of yelling can heard from thousands of miles. This... this was their ultimate purpose in life. This is the culmination of everything that has happened in human history, it is reason why life even existed in the first place. They weren't screaming in terror, they were shouting in orgasmic joy. They could finally die happy. Their entire lives flashed before their eyes as they saw their loved ones. They saw their ultimate fantasy. They can finally be freed from their imperfect bodies in this imperfect world.

The Sun blinked out. The Moon crashed into the Earth. The Earth turned into dust. The Solar System collapsed into a state of entropy. The Milky Way hosts a firework show of supernovas. All the galaxies of the universe colliding with one another. Reality is falling apart. That's because reality doesn't need to exist anymore. It has reached its goal. Spacetime has fallen. Matter ceases to exist. Not even the concept of nothing exists. The universe was never born.

Humanity is gone. Everything is gone. We are now one. Evil doesn't exist anymore. Insecurities don't exist anymore.  Fear, sadness, anger don't exist anymore. Just hope, love, and harmony for eternity. This is what we were meant to be. This is our final evolution stage.

This is heaven. This is what it means to be happy.

Mine Craft.,"""M-m... M""
No one was paying attention in the crossroads of New York as I was giving my speech.
""M-m-mine...""
However, one person was intrigued in what I was saying.
""M-m-m-minecraft...""
Then it was just a domino effect, ten more people are watching.
""Minecraft...""
A hundred were now watching, this had caught the attention of even the busy drivers in rush hour. Their faces in anticipation, some were even scared. Others were complaining that this isn't the real deal.
""MINECRAFT...""
But they all suddenly started cheering, shaking, praying. When they heard my tone, my pitch, my timbre.... they all knew what was going to come next. They realized... that salvation of the human race has finally come.
""Minecraft good Fortnite bad""
And then the silence broke
""OOOIOIIUUUUUGHHHhJJHHHHHWAASEAAAa//::""
Thousands of people fell to their knees, yelling orgasmically. People starting crying tears of joy, others were running and thanking God, News reporters were already on the scene, broadcasting the entire thing nationwide and consequently the entire world. Hundreds of people came out of their cars, buses, taxis, stores, and subway stations hooting and hollering. It was a miracle unfolding.
I started to say the next sentence relayed to me by our Lord and Savior.
""M-m-mi... Mine...""
Already some people fainted at just the mere sound of my voice. Even more people came. Some were jumping from planes thousands of feet in the air, others ran or swam miles to here in mere seconds. I think I even spotted a few famous people.
""MINE...""
Nearly a million people were here now. There's now Europeans, Canadians, Mexicans, Latin Americans, West Coasters, Africans, and even several Asians and one Australian. They were screaming hysterically, bringing gifts for me, taking pictures and videos. Fireworks and confetti everywhere, helicopters, and even Donald Trump was here with his family bowing down to me.
""MINEC-C-C-CRAFT voice crack""
A billion people were here now. Even animals from all over the world were coming in herds. I could see Pewdiepie &amp;amp;amp;amp; Martiza, Elon Musk, Keanu Reeves, Lil Nas X, 50 Cent, Oprah Winfrey, the Kardashians, and so many other people. Many people were having seizures, heart attacks, and strokes from the sheer excitement, and some were being trampled to death because of the huge crowd. The screaming was deafening. Some just came straight out of their bathroom, school, work, or their parenting... but it doesn't matter now.
""MMMMMMIIIIINNNNEEECRAAAFTTTTT""
No matter what was your race, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, economic class, etc... it didn't matter. All of humanity has come together for this one moment. Millions of people have died to due plane crashes, car crashes, doctors abandoning their patients, parents abandoning their children... just to be here, but it will all be worth it.
Nearly half of humanity is here now. Even the dead came out their graves for this. Everyone is climbing on top of each other and on the walls of skyscrapers since they couldn't fit. So many lights, music, dancing, feasts... yet barely a minute passed. Humanity is very interesting.
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...
I look at the smiling faces of the crowd in front of me. I look at the death and destruction that came from sacrifice to attend this event. This is it. We're ready.
0.
""Minecraft good Fortnite bad Instagram normie Emojis bad Keanu breathtaking Wholesome 100 [Everyone liked that] Area 51 PETA bad 69 nice 420""
""AaAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAyyyYYYYYYYYYYYyaYayaYaASyAAaYaaYayaAAAaaUGgGHHhHHhhHHhhHHh😩😩👅👄👀🥵🥵mmmmMMMMmMmMMMMMMMMM😭🤯😱😂🤣😍🤪💦hhhhhhHhFFFfffF""
Billions of people around the world disintegrated into their pure chemical compounds that composed their bodies, then their atoms, then their protons/neutrons/electrons, and finally their quarks... as they heard that holy sentence. The distant echoes of yelling can heard from thousands of miles. This... this was their ultimate purpose in life. This is the culmination of everything that has happened in human history, it is reason why life even existed in the first place. They weren't screaming in terror, they were shouting in orgasmic joy. They could finally die happy. Their entire lives flashed before their eyes as they saw their loved ones. They saw their ultimate fantasy. They can finally be freed from their imperfect bodies in this imperfect world.
The Sun blinked out. The Moon crashed into the Earth. The Earth turned into dust. The Solar System collapsed into a state of entropy. The Milky Way hosts a firework show of supernovas. All the galaxies of the universe colliding with one another. Reality is falling apart. That's because reality doesn't need to exist anymore. It has reached its goal. Spacetime has fallen. Matter ceases to exist. Not even the concept of nothing exists. The universe was never born.
Humanity is gone. Everything is gone. We are now one. Evil doesn't exist anymore. Insecurities don't exist anymore. Fear, sadness, anger don't exist anymore. Just hope, love, and harmony for eternity. This is what we were meant to be. This is our final evolution stage.
This is heaven. This is what it means to be happy.
Congratulations."

Stay hydrated homies,"✨🎩not interested, but I’ll share my Skin care routine✨🐍 males only ✨🍆

✨🃏3 steps in order:✨😊


✨🎩exfoliate: vitamins C facial wash (target-blue/pink)


✨😊cleansers: alcohol free stridex


✨🐍moisturizer: any face mask+

✨🌞Day - ceraVe 
✨🌙Night- Nivea cream✨🌚


✨☝🏼additional step if you really have bad skin. I would recommend Rodan+fields redefine pore minimizing toner. ✨🃏It basically makes your pores smaller, and helps even out the shade/color/ tone of your face to be more uniformed✨🎩

How do I feel about it?,"How do I feel about it?🤔 Idk man 🤨, honestly I’ve been thinking 🤔 nonstop about how i’m gonna get my salad tossed this weekend. Like seriously no joke bro  24/7 , I’m just thinking of getting my s a l a d t o s s e d with extra dressing 😫💦 if you catch my drift . I don’t mean to be rude but you should try it sometime, trust me it ain’t gay, it’s only gay if you think it’s gay, ok?"
You have to have a very high IQ to understand British Humour,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand British Humour. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also the British nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into their characterisation- their personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike British Humor truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate it. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Simon Peg's genius wit unfolds itself on their movie screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a blackadder tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎"

Sudo," XKCD got it wrong 😂. Sudo is not 🙅‍♀️  about doing something that the  subject didn't want to do in the first 👆 place, it's a matter of saying  🙌 'no🖐️, I'm authorized to issue that👆 command'. It's not 🙅‍♂️ that  your brain 🧠 isn't authorized to open your eyes 👀 or that someone's  not 🙅‍♂️ authorized to ask you to make them a sandwich🥪.  Better  examples are 'sudo don't 🙅‍♀️ write ✍️ me a parking ticket' or like  automatic doors🚪  not opening when ⏰ someone walks up👆 to them but  then they issue a sudo command and they do. 🙄😏"

My Cum Booger Story 😳😳,"One day ☀️ I jerked off, 👊🏿💦 and went to the bathroom 🚽 for the post-orgasm piss. 😳 I saw, for lack of a better term, 📚 cum booger on the tip of my dick, 🍆 so I pulled it out. 😖👌🏿 It turned out to be attached to 🤏🏿 a full length cum snot string 🕸 partway down my urethra 🕳 . It was the most unique 🤔 feeling as it came out. Then I threw it in the bathtub 🛁. I watched it squirm and struggle as I drowned it in Suave™️ Daily Men's Shampoo. 🧼. At night 🌙, I can still 👂 the cum booger squirm in my walls. 🤭"

bone hurting copypasta,"when the subreddit was first created, it was basically like 📷[r/okbuddyretard](https://www.reddit.com/r/okbuddyretard/), just random stupid memes that made no sense. but over time, us mods slowly made more and more rules, creating a really specific and convoluted definition for what a bonehurtingjuice meme is supposed to be that nobody could agree on, not even us moderators. but we still fruitlessly tried to enforce these vague guidelines, trying to keep the posts ""quality"", but of course it would never happen because the rules make no sense. it's just so stupid to be a fucking unpaid janitor for this terrible corporate platform and trying to be the ultimate judge of what is Funny when the sub was just supposed to be random shit anyway. so we decided to destroy the subreddit with Operation Chungus.

a few days ago, we restricted the subreddit so only mods and certain users from our discord could join, changed the subreddit style to a mess of random images, and posted a ton of really shitty memes from 📷[r/dankmemes](https://www.reddit.com/r/dankmemes/) and 📷[r/pewdiepiesubmissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/pewdiepiesubmissions/) and google images and stuff like that. the whole thing was a big joke to shit on this website. in a way, it was a return to the very beginning of bhj, where the sub was tiny and it was just really stupid memes. jokes like this aren't really new thing for bhj. we've had shit like this with the racist mario and grinch ""hacks"". but this was different. those were temporary jokes just for fun. but Operation Chungus was an actual attempt to PERMANENTLY ruin the subreddit.

while operation chungus was happening, a lot of people were obviously upset. but no matter how upset you are, that does not excuse encouraging us to kill ourselves or calling us slurs, or other nasty shit like that. one person even tried (and completely failed) to dox one of us. here is just a small sampling of shit that has been said to us: [https://imgur.com/a/XzVbn7T](https://imgur.com/a/XzVbn7T) This doesn't make us want to bring back the subreddit, it makes us want to keep it locked out of spite. Fuck you if you sent shit like this.

But all those people are ultimately just a vocal minority. most of the people who use are subreddit are just disappointed that they can't use this subreddit that they liked. i feel kinda bad, because it's shitty to just take away something harmless that people enjoy just because we personally dislike it. i had a lot of fun with Operation Chungus, but it's run its course, and it's time to reopen the sub. especially because [/u/kirbizia](https://www.reddit.com/u/kirbizia/), the sub's founder, wants us to do so. the only reason she hasn't just kicked us all off the mod team is because we're her friends. i think it would be really disrespectful to go against what she wants us to do. also the reddit admins are on our ass now, so we don't really have a choice lol.

the mod team is still conflicted on whether or not to keep the subreddit closed forever, so i just said ""fuck it"" and decided to rip the bandaid off and post this. sorry to the other mods but i really don't give a shit anymore lmao. as for the future of the subreddit, i have no idea what's gonna happen now, but most of us are definitely not gonna be active moderators anymore. for now, just have fun i guess.

edit: kirbizia doesn't care about this subreddit any more than we do, the main reason she wanted us to revert is because people kept asking her about it"
Regarding the accusations being made against me...,"I'd just like to clear something up regarding the accusations being made against me by some of the female members in this group. The accusations in regard to my behaviour are untrue and very hurtful. 😤 

To the accusers (and you know who you are), here are a few points for your consideration. 🧐

1. Yes I have been asking for feet pictures in the DM's (apparently this isn't appropriate for some) so I do apologise for that. 😔

2. I have never taken screenshots of the feet that have been sent to me. 🤬

3. I would never screenshot or save a private foot pic (unless of course, you wanted me to 😘).

4. No I have not been making ""threats"" to those who ignore my messages. 😡

Hopefully this clears a few things up with the disgruntled members of the group. 😌 

PS. Most of the females in this group are so awesome
❤️❤️❤️ 😘"
My dick did not fit,When I tried to fit it in🍆🍑my eggplant was too abnormaly large for this individual virgin mary. I have no idea why because i though that having big eggplant is a good thing not something that prevents you from the cherished intercourse. Also i think she was down because of my hair line because she lactated on it for some reason. I still got to cummy in her mouth which was very fun. Also she wanted for me to condom?

It was 2 AM sharp. My bowels were shredded from the Taco Bell I had for brunch, lunch, linner, and dinner. I should’ve been dead, but instead, I had to make a poop. Real mfing bad. Rushing to the Motherfucking bathroom, which was just around the jewish corner, I could feel my intestines loosening with every step I took. 

When I sat down though, something was off. My military training taught me to recognize any smell. I was **VERY** familiar with this smell...foot sweat. This horrendous yet in some deeper way beautiful stench wasn’t mine, I knew that for certain. My sweat glands were damaged on all four limbs after an explosion during Iraq, 2003.  

The odd smell immediately triggered me to throw then stand up, cock out. Looking down into the toilet bowl I came, as it seemed that I was right about what was in the shitter.. Down in the toilet bowl appeared to be a small child’s foot severed at the ankle. I didn’t know what to do, who to call, who to fuck, anything. I probably stared at the Motherfucking thing in horror and horniness for a good 45 minutes.

Suddenly the foot twitched, and my now erect cock with it. The toes suddenly stretched to at least ten yards between each toe, it didn’t reach out and grab me or anything, admittedly much to my sexual disappointment, but it was just so fucking epic (unnatural) that it really freaked me out. I didn’t call mum because I knew I would just have yet another murder charge on my hands. So in a panicked and instinctual state, I quickly smashed the handle down flushing the leghand away. 

I never came disappointingly and I can’t suck your dick, I mean prove that this ever even really happened in the fourtth place. It didn’t touch me or leave me with PTSD, but I can assure you I came by thinking about it every time I use that bathroom, my bloodflow instinctually directs itself to my Cock &amp; BalLs."

When people say music is dead this is what they mean.....,When people say music is dead this is what they mean..... Compared to previous mainstream music of the past. It is dead in all generes. For example if you compare the 90s mainstream hip hop artists and songs to now. We had Tupac biggie snoop dog bone thugs and harmony naughty by nature the fugies Nas. The list goes on now if we compared that to mainstream artists now like Lil pump Travis Scott and the songs they have made compared to the songs the 90s artists I listed they do not come close. It's not debatable if it was people wouldn't be saying music is dead another example that its dead is the mainstream rock music of today compared to the mainstream rock music of the 90s and early 2000s how can we even compare it because there is no rock music of today that is mainstream and popular..... Imagine dragons? Not rock music they have zero electric guitars panic at the disco not rock music it sounds electronic and the lead singer is singing with Taylor swift compared to mainstream rock music of the 90s and early 2000s we had nirvana Korn limp bizkit Linkin park Greenday slipknot blink 182 they all used electric guitars in there songs they all had hits rock is dead now why they all decided to go soft and take the guitars out of there songs which eventually made rock music dissappear next example mainstream pop music now Ariana grande Niki minage one direction all are okay artists that's had a few nice songs but let's compare it to 90s artists like Britney Christina Ricky Martin nsync backstreet boys Michael Jackson Mariah Carey Whitney Houston Boys to men 98 degrees TLC......... SWV destiny's child Lauren Hill......hahaha lol 😂 the list I just made is where your entire argument falls apart and dies. Like this generation of music if we compare song for song of mainstream 90s early 2000s vs now........ Now loses in a utterly embarrassing fashion lol 😂 that's what it means to say music is dead nobody can write a mainstream song that compares to previous generations we can have arguments about what generation is better 50s 60s 70s 80s 90s early 2000s but now? That's a joke just like this video 😂
Reddit is bad for your mental health,"I have since deleted the app because I’ve woken up and decided all of you (who will definitely get offended by this) are keyboard activists, SJW’s, neckbeards, or snowflakes. Don’t bother throwing hate my way cause once I post this shit I’m never coming back here again. If you look at my previous post and comments, you will see that I was rather kind and respectful (yes I will kiss my own ass) to anyone and everyone. Now, for the real kicker. All of those who will get offended (I am now talking to you, sir) are awful people who are no brain hater that probably grew up in a broken home raised by a self conscious mother who subconsciously tossed her problems onto you, her one night stand present. Reddit is by far the most toxic, censored, absolutely disgusting app I have ever seen and by god I wish some competitor would put it out of its fucking misery. Will this whole rant make me feel better? Momentarily yes. Am I being just as horrible as the fat neckbeards that lay in their 600 dollar gaming chair thinking calling people slurs gives them the emotional gratification that they never got from a loving family? Oh yes. But at this point fuck it. Fuck you. Fuck this app. Delete it and get some fucking help. Oh and also, everything on here is far from original. Go shove a pixie stick up your urethras you old paint cans.🖕"

Disney plus is RACIST!!!!!!☝️🍑👀😅🤠🍖👊☝️🤐😲🤯🤮🤧😷🥴🤒🥵🤕😤😡🤬,"Some of Disney's older movies — like ""Dumbo,"" ""Peter Pan"" and ""Fantasia"" — contain a disclaimer on Disney Plus, the company's new streaming service: “This program is presented as originally created. It may contain outdated cultural depictions.""😳

TV expert Bob Thompson🤵 joined Boston Public Radio Monday to discuss whether or not the sand dingus', southern Africano's, ritalin retard's and taco smashers know that this goes far enough in addressing some of the company's films, which critics say are racist, sexist and outdated.🍑☝️🤠

The company “needs to follow through in making a more robust statement that this was wrong, and these depictions were wrong,” said Psyche Williams-Forson 👰, chairwoman of American studies at the University of Maryland at College Park. “Yes, we’re at a different time, but we’re also not at a different time. I think Disney needs to stop being such hypocrite neo-nazis and make movies solely based on gender neutrality, lgbtqaids&amp;HIV, and more important social issues (ex. Transgender bathroom crisis, EVIL trump, boomer syndrome, and the lack of government funding for rainbow cross walks. MAYBE then we can finally get home entertainment that makes the whole family comfortable."" 👩‍👩‍👦‍👦👩‍👩‍👦👩‍👧‍👧👩‍👧‍👦👩‍👧👩‍👦‍👦👩‍👦👪👩‍👩‍👧‍👧👩‍👩‍👧‍👦👩‍👩‍👧👨‍👩‍👧‍👧👨‍👨‍👧👨‍👨‍👦‍👦👨‍👩‍👧‍👦👨‍👩‍👧👨‍👨‍👦👨‍👧‍👦👨‍👩‍👦‍👦👨‍👩‍👦👨‍👧👨‍👦‍👦👨‍👨‍👧‍👧👨‍👨‍👧‍👦👨‍👦"

"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand 6ix9ines music","To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand 6ix9ine's music. The music is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of experimental music most of the lines will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also 6ix9ines's capitalist outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Karl Marx

literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this music, to realise that they're not just bops- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike 6ix9ine truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in 6ix9ines's existential catchphrase ""SCUUUUM GAAANGGG,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as 6ix9ines's genius wit unfolds itself on their spotify playlist. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

&amp;#x200B;

And yes, by the way, i DO have a 6ix9ine tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎"
Campers unite!!!!,"Been seeing a lot of posts about camping ruins the game. Ok. But hear me out. I’m not good. I like to go slow. I love to camp. Not everyone is on drugs, geeked out on Mountain Dew, and Riddlin. Or whatever. I smoke weed, it makes me feel good, and very slow. I’m old, can’t see good, and love to kill the fast moving, high kill rate asshats that think they are a gaming god. When I hear them die after I kill them from the weeds, saying “omg, you camping bleeeeeeep!” I laugh, it tickles my insides, and I kinda pee a little into my depends. Ha! Suck it. Tell me ok boomer, I’m not but I’d rather side with age over youth any day. I love everyone, even people I don’t like, or say mean and bad things to me. Life goes on. And you don’t own me, or this game. So let’s just say what the real problem is on this game. Feelings getting hurt because your ratio isn’t the best in all of the solarverse!!!!! Get a life, get a job, or come over and get high with me , and you’ll laugh your ass off when we camp kill your buddies, and you hear them scream in agony, like they just lost a leg in a war in real life. It’s absurd that we can’t camp, or get shamed for doing so. Guess what. My kill ratio is like negative 1000000. And I don’t care. If you do, look at yourself, your tactics, and your meds. I actually get mad sometimes when the fast moving, ADD kill everyone high score player kills me 30000. Times before I can even reload once! But I just play my game, the slow game. Just have fun your way. It’s a game. And camping is here to stay, forever. Also, down vote me to the Bowles of hell, I’m used to it, and it makes me laugh even harder. I have been banned from so many subs, just for stating the obvious, or speaking my mind. But guess what? I’ll be back! Hahahahahahhaha Peace to all people, all races, everywhere. I do love you all, even if you hate me, which is probably everyone on here. Because my fellow campers won’t get my back, and that’s ok. I love them too. Now start your downvote fingers!!!!!!!!!!

Why does it seem whenever a female post a pic of themself," Why does it seem whenever a female post a pic of themself on social  media everyone comes out of the woodwork to comment some variation of  ""OMG so cute 😍😍😍 👌👌👌 💖💖💖""?  Is it them trying to flirt with OP? In that case do they actually  believe it is a useful method of attracting a partner? Do they think at  they will pick them out of the sea of similar comments? Is it because of  some sort of social contract of obligation I'm not aware of at whenever  a female post a selfie it must be met with those types of comments, and  if so what is the purpose of this obligation? Why does this phenomenon  keep on occurring?"

found on a monster energy facebook post post talking about papa roach,"Wow, I might be retarded in your eyes but I'm no where near as retarded as all you fucknuts are for replying. So what if I enjoyed Papa Roach when I was 12, and how edgy of you to call me a school shooter. And the only thing getting cucked is you, ask your girlfriend how I was bigger and better with it than you ever will be. 😘  
Also I generally listen to Soundgarden and Alice in Chains these days. Thank you for judging someone's musical taste on one post. You now have unlocked the ""Biggest Idiot on the Internet"" achievement. Fuck I'm gonna enjoy beating off to all the salt you guys have ground up for me."

sjws," I, for one, am pretty damn tired of the oppression of Americans, particularly white American males, in the name of political correctness. You need to quit this. For one thing, it was not always Pilgrims and Indians sharing food together. Many of the Indians were vicious killers, not purely directed at the white invaders, but directed at other tribes. Of course, history is currently being rewritten by socialist democrats and our education system is feeling it. I anticipate a load of downvotes, but hey, WTFC? W is who, in this case, C is cares. You can figure the rest.

In the meantime, doubt and chastise me all you want, but if you have any semblance of common sense, do the research. And as far as conquerors actually conquering someone, IT HAPPENED ALL THE TIME BACK THEN! It was accepted by every nation and people. It sucked for the losers but let’s not forget what the Romans did, among hundreds of others. Or is that too far back for you to understand?😡🤬"

RISK,"I don't have a college degree.

I don't have rich parents.

I waitressed for 10 years.

I sang at dive bars for $50 a night.

So why the heck am I now, at age 27, a successful entrepreneur with a 7-figure online business?

One word: ❗️ RISK! ❗️

I'm always going against the grain. 

🔹

I dropped out of college, risking my future.

I reconnected with my music dream. I took a risk putting myself out there- I was terrified that first night on stage.

Risk.

I quit music &amp; waitressing at age 23 and decided to pursue entrepreneurship instead. Despite feeling terrified of not having a job, despite worrying I was ""selling out"" on myself and my dreams. 

Risk.

I took on a half a million dollar investment at age 24, despite being young... despite knowing it was a pretty big risk. 

I became a COO who managed an office of 30+ employees, without any previous management experience.

That was a risk.

I sold that business at age 26. 

That was also a risk. 

🔹

My life has been a series of being uncomfortable.

None of these events were comfortable, graceful, or even enjoyable really. 

But I did it,

and THAT'S why I'm here.

🔹

How has DIScomfort affected YOUR life for the better?

"Mmm, lick the balls of my feet.."," Mmm, lick the balls of my feet.. 👢That's the most sensetive part. I'm so glad I caught you smelling my dirty boots earlier today, step bro. You're gonna be my foot slave from now on. Every single night after your dad and my mom have gone to bed, you'll sneak into my room to worship my feet 'till I fall asleep. You don't want me to tell your dad that you have a thing for your own step sister's sweaty tights? That's right. I'll let everyone know you like stinky feet unless you obey me. I will put plastic bags over my feet when showering from now on too. That way my feet will never be washed. Every night you will start by massaging my soles gently, and sniff between my toes, where all the toejam is. I will love feeling your nose buried in my soles, inhaling my foot odor. After that, I'll relax and lay down, and you'll lick my feet clean. Every. Single. Crevice. Of my dirty soles. You will proceed this 'til I'm asleep. Oh, don't stop! Get back to it! This is the first foot worship session. Don't pretend like you don't like this. I know you love y sweaty feet..'' 👢"

Funny foot fetish story for ya.,"Funny foot fetish story for ya. Was at my buddy's place for a party. He gave me attitude for wearing shoes in ""his"" house... which btw was his PARENT'S house. I told him off but everyone took his side, 
 so I took them off. But I wasn't gonna let it go. I waited until he left his phone on the counter and I took it. I knew his unlock code because we USED to be good friends before this. 

I waited until he went to the bathroom and then I hid in a closet. From there, I posted foot fetish shit on his facebook and mass-texted it to his contacts. I pretended it was an ""accident"". Then I put his phone where I got it. When he came out of the bathroom people saw his shit and got creeped out. I said ""that's why you want everyone's shoes off at your place??"" and people got outraged

He tried saying it wasn't him but people just walked out. Some girl tipped every flower vase on her way out, another chick spilled her wine on the floor before leaving. When it was just him and me, I looked into his eyes and I said ""nobody will ever believe you"". After putting on my shoes, I made sure to step on his carpet. he just stood there like he was gonna cry

He spent a month trying to deny the allegations, but I was always there. I told people how I saw him looking at foot fetish shit before and how he talked about wanting to lick female classmates' feet. He got so angry about my lies that nobody took him seriously - people decided that his anger was proof of his guilt. He just gave up, shut down all his social media and people just forgot about him. Not sure what he's doing now, it's been 4 years and nobody I know has heard a single thing about him. Lmao. The last thing I heard was some boyfriends of some girls who were there beat his ass for being a pervert

Just a bit of good clean fun 😎 next time don't tell me to take my shoes off. \*hits vape*

"IAMA, I am considered a “boomer” and get bullied for it","I was born before all you libtards. I want to end the discrimination against us boomers. We get harassed daily because we “ruined the economy” or some bull hockey. When I hear the phrase “ok boomer” I cry heavily. Do you really think this is some sort of joke? This isn’t funny pal. I was born before all you libtards, but you treat me like shit. I think revolution is near, children. Your fancy words insulting us won’t do much in an all out war, now will they?

"Well guys, we did it.","Hentai is officially for kids.You see, hentai is animated, and according to the FTC, only children enjoy animations. Hentai also contains color, and as we all know, you become colorblind when you turn 18. Hentai also contains cartoon characters (obviously). And what child does not want to watch porn, animated or not? So as you can see, hentai checks out as a kid friendly G-rated experience, as it checks many boxes for what qualifies as kids content. 

(Edit 1) wait guys there are police at my door what did I do wrong 

(Edit 2) apparently it’s because I showed hentai to my 5 year old. Like wtf the FTC says it’s kid friendly 🤷‍♀️

found this on r/deltarune . op is ralsei.," 

# I am the human Ralsei (please take this seriously) (feel free to ask questions) (Much more nicely edited and understandable repost)

📷

When Deltarune first came out I didn't play it. a lot of my friends did though. they all said one thing in common. that i was a lot like Ralsei. i played it off as a joke because i didn't understand. then this one time in 10th period last year (6th grade btw) someone told me that i should really play deltarune. so i did.

The second i saw Ralsei and the way he acts (no pun intended) i knew why my friends compared me to him. i'm the most kind in my school, i know how to bake cakes, i hate the thought of murder, and many others i cant think of off the top of my head. (i will add any additional things in a reply)

INTRESTING FACTS:

I have the exact mindset of the little goat darkener that is Ralsei (idk why i worded it like that) i even look like Ralsei. i have glasses. i have nice floofy hair (idk how to explain this part well) , i wear a nice pink scarf occasionally. and i even have someone who acts like kris too me. she has ""accidentally"" kissed my hand (that was really ironic when it happened. were good friends now but it took a little adjustment to the constant hugging/ other stuff) unironically my friends have told me that if toby ever needed someone to be a Ralsei voice actor, that i'd be the right person to do that. my voice sounds like the fluffy boi. whenever i talk my voice does the exact pitch of Ralsei's dialogue sound. i have an exact lightner trio in my school. a Kris, a Susie and Ralsei (me)! Every teacher in my school really likes me. A lot of kids say that they hate certain teachers. i cant see that because i'm so darn nice to them. My dad is pretty well known around my town. (he's one of the coaches for the highschool basketball team) and his fame has really opened me up as being the ""nice"" kid in the town. My dad is very athletic though (i'm not at all) so i get a lot of people asking me to play basketball (witch i wont lol)

SOMETHING A BIT MORE PERSONAL (but i'm sharing it anyway):

As the holiday season comes closer and i get myself ready for the holidays, the weather outside gets colder and colder, and i just adapt to the coldness and love the holidays. i've worn my scarf to school a lot more now (every day to be in fact) and the bullies have targeted me a lot more then they used to (see bullying question and answer for more) i already made a batch of Christmas cookies before thanksgiving. And i have'nt noticed how i really am Ralsei. I used to think i stated acting more like him since Ive played the game but i was wrong. looking back at old Christmas photos have really brought the memories back. I struggled a lot with school in 5th grade and it really took a toll on my personality. it was one of the only 2 times i decided to try to be ""cool"". witch in all actuality is just plain mean. in 6th grade i decided to try again with my personality. it worked and i remembered who i really was inside. That nice kid who always acted kinda like a girl, and i even used to help in the class where kids with disabilities went to. (they were all super cute ngl). i just wish i could repay some of the people in the grade below me. i did some stuff that i sincerely regret. but the grades are sectioned off in my school. it's a pretty small nice school. so i will eventually get to repay myself. and that day will feel good.

So if you have any questions then you can ask me.

To summarize: I'm basically Ralsei. i act like Ralsei and look like Ralsei (minus the fluff) and if Ralsei was a 7th grader, then it would be me exactly. my friends even call me Ralsei

ALREADY ANSWERED QUESTIONS  
Q: Whats your name?  
A: John  
Q: I'm curious now as to your voice and appearance. I'm glad your friends compliment you in this way too!  
A: i would send an image. but 1. i have no image of me with my scarf. 2. i like to be careful who i reveal my face too  
Q: Have you ever done any comic dubs?  
A: No. i'd try one if i can find one that i actually like and is not cringe. i'm nota ""that fandom"" kind of guy. i'm more of the ""stay cannon to the game"" and maybe some humorous ones. AUs aren't my kind of thing ether  
Q: Is it hard to be Ralsei? Even to bullies?  
A: It depends on the situation. a lot of times just a small bit of kindness can make a whole day be better. at other times it can be a lot harder. I get a lot of my friends asking me some very personal stuff, but i understand and help them get through hard times and stuff like that. As for bullies. Well, i get bullied a lot. Like i mean A LOT. So sticking up for myself can be hard sometimes. But I don't let it take over my life like it does to some people. I have a friend who gets bullied as much as me and she takes it very personally. I stick up for her a lot. so much that a lot of people in my school ship us. (just another reason that i'm like ralsei. lol) so yeah sorry that this reply is so long. Didn't mean it to be this way."
JoJo grandpa," 😡😡😡 My grandson ordered an item from that amazon site called “R.E.O speedwagon body pillow”. At first I was thrilled, because I thought the kid was finally growing up to appreciate the classic music his grandpappy (me) grew up on... then the package came and it was some half-naked cartoon ladyboy!

Hello.,"Hello and pleasured to be of welcome to you. There are three things you should know about me that differentiate me from the average person. You can find these topics below.

FIRST- I am a doctor. Although I just graduated, I have already saved countless lives. In fact, I recently saved the life of a reddit exec’s daughter after a vicious pitbull attack that would have been fatal. Luckily I used my expertise to give her back her life. Because of this, I now have the ability to ban anyone on this site. If I see anyone swear or break any of my rules, I will not hesitate to ban him/her. 

SECOND - Meat eater. I enjoy a variety of meats that the average human wouldn’t have the cognizance to enjoy. Some of these include: Smoked sausage, grilled sausage, baked sausage, boiled sausage, steamed sausage, microwaved sausage, and tofu. If you come here to preach vegetarianism, I will have you swiftly REMOVED

THIRD - Certified pussy connoisseur. If you’re looking for tips on how to get the “good stuff” (as I call it), you came to the right place. Some of my favorites include: Siberian (generally very cold and crunchy, similar to eating a snow cone [or frozen peas if they are on the heavier side]), Bulgarian (generally unwashed so you get a more robust flavor. Like sipping a strong coffee) and Hawaiian (produces an aroma similar to coconuts and thatched roofs). 

Make sure you do not swear or discuss vegetarianism in this comment section or you WILL be sorry.

P. S. Visit /r/emojisquad and I’ll give you a free BJ 😮 (18+ only please.... 👴)"

The Day I Fucked My Ceiling Fan,"I stared up at the freshly dusted fan and couldnt help but lust after it. I quickly went and grabbed a ladder from the garage and set it up. I unbuttoned my pants and started to ascend to the zenith of pleasure. I feel the cool air of the ceiling fan blow on my dick. ""I'm ready."" I muttered. I proceed to slowly raise my cock, which is now rock hard, into the spinning blades of the fan. The rhythmic thwack of flesh on wood is like music to my ears. Each blade pass sending pain and ecstasy through my throbbing member. I eye the small chain that dangles from the fan and wonder if it would work as an anal bead With my dong spinning around the blades like a rubber band, I raise my ass towards the small chain. I insert it into my asshole with a loud moan and proceed to cum all over the blades, making me even more horny.  The fresh semen spreads along the fan blades and  begins to flick off and paint parts of my wall a milky white. The scent of mushrooms begins to fill the air circulating around the room. For a moment I lose my balance on the ladder and the blades begin to slap my ass like a father disciplining their toddler.📷**1**📷**1**📷**1**📷**1**The rush of adrenaline from the blades smacking my asscheeks makes me horny enough to cum again, this time all over my cat who has just entered the room and recieved a sniper shot to the left eye. He shrieks in pure horror and runs out of the room, but i don't care. the pleasure I am experiencing is beyond his understanding.  I slip off the ladder and pucker my asshole. I hang from the chain inside my asshole like a bat. The chain clicks and the fan begins to stop spinning. Now, finally, the fan is ready for me to penetrate its inner oiled bits.  I insert my dick into the fans internals, the electronics and other parts scraping my dick like a cheese grater, but i don't care. my blood play fetish came in handy, and the pain of my dick scraping against the inside parts of the fan makes me cum over and over again. this continues for hours on end, until the walls are painted a new coat of white. The room now smells like salty coins and milk, a delightful scent. My cat has fallen under cardiac arrest and died of shock, but weaklings die, big deal. Today was a wonderful day. I can't wait to do it again. As I go to remove my dick from the inner machine I realize that my softened member has been sucked up to the gears..... the fan does not want me to leave it. I have become one with my love. I'm happy as I spin from the ceiling with my love."

uwu,"Daddy’s 🧔 cummies, 💦 nice 😊 and yummy 😋

Thick 😫👌and gooey, feel like honey 🍯

That sweet 🍭 milk, 🥛 oh-so-tasty 🤤

Daddy, 🧔 Daddy, 🧔 please be hasty!💨

My tongue 👅 swirls 😛 round 🔁 and round 🔁

While Daddy 🧔 gives my ass 🍑 a great big pound 🤜💥

Over 😑 in the corner, wrapped 🎁 in chains ⛓

Mommy 👩 huddled over, screaming 😱 in pain 😪

“Shut up, bitch! 👩 Stay on the floor!”

Mommy 👩 sobbing 😭 louder, I 👧 call 🗣 her a whore

She reaches behind her 👩 for her gun 💀

While Daddy gropes 👋 and tickles 🤗 my sweet 🍬 buns 🍑

Puts the barrel 😛 between 👉👈 her teeth 👄

And Daddy’s 🧔 semen 💦 begins to seep ☔️

Gunpowder, blood, 💉 brains 🧠 and gore 😎

Mommy’s 👩 lifeless 👻 corpse slumps ⬇️ to the floor 😂

Cummies, 💦 cummies 💦 filling my throat

My pussy 🐱 is completely 😍 soaked 💦

But Daddy’s cock 🍆 just gets bigger 😳😲

Over near 😯 the drawers, he grabs the scissors ✂️

Cuts 🔪 a hole 🕳 in Mommy’s 👩 stomach

In her hand, 🤲 a gin and tonic 🍺

He 🧔 begins to unravel her strings of intestines 😝

“Look 👀 closely, you’ll learn 👨‍🏫 a lesson”

Ties a noose, 😔 rigs it tight 😫

“Sweetie, 👧 sweetie, 👧 no need to fight” 👊💥

Puts her 👩 guts 🤤 around 🔄 my neck

“Looks like everything’s good 👍 and set” 👌

Lets me fall down ⬇️ about 🤔💭 a yard

Face 👧 turning blue, choking 🤭 hard 💪

All the while, 🕑 Daddy’s 🧔 stroking his cock 🍆

And for a moment, 😳 our eyes 👁 lock 🔒

Tears 😭 of joy 😊 stream down my face 👧

I’m going to 😵 a better ✨ place~"

Courtesy to @metaphysicalmeagan on the gram," For the past few weeks I have included sunning my bum &amp; yoni🌺 into my daily rising routine. •  
☀️Many of you have been asking about the benefits of this practice:  
⚡️30 seconds of sunlight on your butthole is the equivalent of a full day of sunlight with your clothes on!⚡️  
Taught by [@ra\_of\_earth](https://www.instagram.com/ra_of_earth/) &amp; [@certifiedhealthnut](https://www.instagram.com/certifiedhealthnut/) (This is an ancient Taoist practice that’s been around for a while!)  
Things I’ve noticed personally In my reality since I’ve implemented this:  
🌞Surges of energy almost immediately!  
🌞Better Sleep  
🌞Better connection to my Sexual energy &amp; control of my Life Force⚡️  
🌞So much Creativity flowing through my life!!🧡  
🌞Attracting my desires &amp; intentions with ease.  
🌞Attracting soul tribe &amp; people who are on the same frequency and wavelength as me.  
☀️I’m spending a maximum of 5 minutes in the morning doing this. [@ra\_of\_earth](https://www.instagram.com/ra_of_earth/) teaches that 30 seconds is more than enough sunshine exposure down there!  
☕️This  is truly more energizing than slamming cups of coffee and is a great  alternative to consuming neurotoxic coffee &amp; caffeine that can  disrupt your adrenal gland health.☕️  
🌞This is such a simple game changing practice!!  
⚡️Try it out &amp; let me know your experience⚡️ ☀️You can do this any time the sun is out... I prefer early in the morning!

Rise up!,"bukakke_king He feels the cold steel of the gun’s 🔫 slide brush his chin 👨 as he brings it level to himself. He closes his eyes 👀 and under his 🌬 breath, whispers one last cry 😢 for strength. 🗣“Gamers 🎮 don’t die, we respawn” and as those words trickle out of his mouth like a small stream; he squeezes one last tear 💧from the corner of his 👁eye, ☠️as the trigger returns to its resting position, and ultimately the gun drops to the ground. 💀🤑😲

Steve,"Thanking someone on the internet LOL 🤷‍♂️ true example of how cunts love technology so much. If you were a true badass (like me) you would stop living a modern cushy lifestyle and go rough it out in the wilderness like me. If I wasn't, I would go and thank him personally because that's what real men who are badass and not lazy do."

I’m going to tell you and others the truth that sometimes my wife rapes me,I’m going to tell you and others the truth that sometimes my wife rapes me and the first time she started doing it I grinned and asked her how am I supposed to get stimulated and she then tied me down and mopped her tongue in my ears and in my mouth and my belly button and she mounted me and she started riding me as if I was a ten speed bike hitting speed bumps and potholes and after she found what she was looking for she untied me and I was thrilled and she’d do it every time I told her that I was tired 💤 and twenty five years and counting she still does it till this day and when she’s not in the mood and I am she won’t allow me to do her the same way she does me but I’d rather put up with her if she wants me bad enough to rape me.🤣😎

#MiaKhalifa4MsMarvel,"I love marvel movies and the marvel cinematic universe as a whole. I also love Mia khalifa. she's a great actress and has starred in some very well known movies. marvel studios is currently looking for a muslim actress to portray the teenage ms marvel from the comics. Who better is to play her than Mia Khalifa!?!?! she's played a teen before, she's smart, she has a superhero body, she's powerful, and she can really take a good dicking! haha jk about the last part... unless.. 😳

anyways, yeah I think Mia khalifa would be a great ms marvel. movie theatres get your napkin holsters and cleanup crew ready though! jk... unless.. 😳

"I just witnessed someone say this in a Facebook group, during an argument over the correct way to hold a firearm in a car group","Easy, you be cool and lethal in real life.  As well as having private investigator software on your computer that allows you to search people and find their address, family members, credit card use, place of work, criminal records down to the parking tickets, all attainable by having a Facebook page link and or even less info than that.  Allowing you to intercept people without them even knowing anything is going on.  That helps a lot 😉.  But.. it’s just a small piece of the trade of course.  The rest is discretion.  Knowing when to use or not to use those abilities you’re capable of.  Like deciding if a sarcastic little feller who has to use sarcasm to compensate for the lack of being able to please any woman he’s ever been with by being a moron to strangers on the internet.  From there you make the choice to use a social network (one’s you’ve formed by meeting and conversing with people in actual life to extend the reach of your effectiveness to cause “happenings” in areas you’ve never set foot upon.) not social network as in Facebook/MySpace. Anyyywhoo, you use that if you decide you want this person talked to.  Or his family, employers, etc.  to relay the point you wish to make for you.  
But.. you know.. you wouldn’t know anything about that kinda stuff or where to start would you?"
Why rens is a weeb," 

# Why rens is a weeb

**At first I never knew that people could be this dedicated to being a weeb**. **Then we started to watch some Animes together, cause I had never seen them and he wanted to watch some with me.** **This is how I found out Rens is a weeb.**  


After some time after we met he asked me if I ever saw One-Punch or any anime and I said no, since I didn’t watch any anime back than. He asked if I wanted to watch together with him. I agreed to that since I had nothing else to do. So we watched it and I actually didn’t think I would like it, but I did. We didn’t watch anime the next month, but he asked again and I said sure. From that moment I was clueless and sometimes he would get and see references I didn’t understand and might still not understand LOL.  


About half a year later he asked me to make a MyAnimeList, but I already used something else since I thought MyAnimeList was looking quite boring. So we ended up switching both to another website that is called AniList (Highly recommend this, cause it looks modern and has more than MyAnimeList.). But than, than I saw what shit he watched and it supersized me. It a lot more than I had thought. He now almost **40 days** of watch time WOW!  


If you want to know feel free to ask 😉

Performance Artist,"My name is Van, I'm an artist, I'm a performance artist. I'm hired to people to fulfill their fantasies, their deep dark fantasies. I was gonna be a movie star y'know, modeling and acting. After a hundred and two additions and small parts I decided y'know I had enough, Then I got in to Escort world. The client requests contain a lot of fetishes, so I just decided to go y'know... full ♂Master♂ and change my entire house into a dungeon... ♂Dungeon♂Master♂ now with a full dungeon in my house and It's going really well. Fisting is 300 bucks and usually the guy is pretty much hard on pop to get really relaxed y'know and I have this long latex glove that goes all the way up to my armpit and then I put on a surgical latex glove up to my wrist and just lube it up and it's a long process y'know to get your whole arm up there but it's an intense feeling for the other person I think for myself too, you go in places that even though it's physical with your hand but for some reason it's also more emotional it's more psychological too and we both get you know to the same place it's really strange at the same time and I find sessions like that really exhausting. I don't know I feel kinda naked because I am looking at myself for the first time, well not myself but this aspect of my life for the first time and it's been harsh... three to five years already? I never thought about it... Kinda sad I feel kinda sad right now, I don't know why"

🐝 Movie,"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a 🐝ee should 🐝e a🐝le to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little 🐝ody off the ground.

Let's shake it up a little. 🐝arry! 🐝reakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - 🐝arry? - Adam? - Oan you 🐝elieve this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all 🐝's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll 🐝e in row 118,000. - 🐝ye! 🐝arry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, 🐝arry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come 🐝ack different. - Hi, 🐝arry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear a🐝out Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Every🐝ody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. 🐝oy, quite a 🐝it of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - 🐝ee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished 🐝ees, please welcome Dean 🐝uzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And 🐝egins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjo🐝 today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll 🐝e like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a 🐝ee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey 🐝egins when our valiant Pollen Jocks 🐝ring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and 🐝u🐝🐝le-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of 🐝ee existence. These 🐝ees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most 🐝ee jo🐝s are small ones. 🐝ut 🐝ees know that every small jo🐝, if it's done well, means a lot. 🐝ut choose carefully 🐝ecause you'll stay in the jo🐝 you pick for the rest of your life. The same jo🐝 the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll 🐝e happy to know that 🐝ees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That 🐝lew my mind! ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that? One jo🐝 forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. 🐝ut, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're 🐝ees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think may🐝e things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. 🐝ut you know what I'm talking a🐝out. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, 🐝ut some don't come 🐝ack. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to 🐝e a Pollen Jock. You have to 🐝e 🐝red for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status sym🐝ol. 🐝ees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must 🐝e dangerous 🐝eing a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a 🐝ear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - 🐝arry! A puddle jump for us, 🐝ut may🐝e you're not up for it. - May🐝e I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, 🐝uzzy-🐝oy? Are you 🐝ee enough? I might 🐝e. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - 🐝ut you only get one. Do you ever get 🐝ored doing the same jo🐝 every day? Son, let me tell you a🐝out stirring. You gra🐝 that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a 🐝eautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think a🐝out it, may🐝e the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making 🐝alloon animals? That's a 🐝ad jo🐝 for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! - 🐝arry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to 🐝e funny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna 🐝e a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and cele🐝rate! May🐝e I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call every🐝ody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today! - Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jo🐝s will 🐝e gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt 🐝ee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still availa🐝le? - Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side. - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of new🐝ies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What's availa🐝le? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A 🐝ee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt 🐝ee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector num🐝er seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. 🐝arry, what do you think I should... 🐝arry? 🐝arry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, 🐝efore I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling 🐝rave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign here, here. Just initial that. - Thank you. - OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, 🐝ees cannot fly in rain. So 🐝e careful. As always, watch your 🐝rooms, hockey sticks, dogs, 🐝irds, 🐝ears and 🐝ats. Also, I got a couple of reports of root 🐝eer 🐝eing poured on us. Murphy's in a home 🐝ecause of it, 🐝a🐝🐝ling like a cicada! - That's awful. - And a reminder for you rookies, 🐝ee law num🐝er one, a🐝solutely no talking to humans! All right, launch positions! 🐝uzz, 🐝uzz, 🐝uzz, 🐝uzz! 🐝uzz, 🐝uzz, 🐝uzz, 🐝uzz! 🐝uzz, 🐝uzz, 🐝uzz, 🐝uzz! 🐝lack and yellow! Hello! You ready for this, hot shot? Yeah. Yeah, 🐝ring it on. Wind, check. - Antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check. - Wings, check. - Stinger, check. Scared out of my shorts, check. OK, ladies, let's move it out! Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers! All of you, drain those flowers! Wow! I'm out! I can't 🐝elieve I'm out! So 🐝lue. I feel so fast and free! 🐝ox kite! Wow! Flowers! This is 🐝lue Leader. We have roses visual. 🐝ring it around 30 degrees and hold. Roses! 30 degrees, roger. 🐝ringing it around. Stand to the side, kid. It's got a 🐝it of a kick. That is one nectar collector! - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir. I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. May🐝e a dash over there, a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little 🐝it of magic. That's amazing. Why do we do that? That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. Oool. I'm picking up a lot of 🐝right yellow. Oould 🐝e daisies. Don't we need those? Oopy that visual. Wait. One of these flowers seems to 🐝e on the move. Say again? You're reporting a moving flower? Affirmative. That was on the line! This is the coolest. What is it? I don't know, 🐝ut I'm loving this color. It smells good. Not like a flower, 🐝ut I like it. Yeah, fuzzy. Ohemical-y. Oareful, guys. It's a little gra🐝🐝y. My sweet lord of 🐝ees! Oandy-🐝rain, get off there! Pro🐝lem! - Guys! - This could 🐝e 🐝ad. Affirmative. Very close. Gonna hurt. Mama's little 🐝oy. You are way out of position, rookie! Ooming in at you like a missile! Help me! I don't think these are flowers. - Should we tell him? - I think he knows. What is this?! Match point! You can start packing up, honey, 🐝ecause you're a🐝out to eat it! Yowser! Gross. There's a 🐝ee in the car! - Do something! - I'm driving! - Hi, 🐝ee. - He's 🐝ack here! He's going to sting me! No🐝ody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze! He 🐝linked! Spray him, Granny! What are you doing?! Wow... the tension level out here is un🐝elieva🐝le. I gotta get home. Oan't fly in rain. Oan't fly in rain. Oan't fly in rain. Mayday! Mayday! 🐝ee going down! Ken, could you close the window please? Ken, could you close the window please? Oheck out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out 🐝rochure. You see? Folds out. Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this. What was that? May🐝e this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes! That is dia🐝olical. It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies. What's num🐝er one? Star Wars? Nah, I don't go for that... ...kind of stuff. No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds. When I leave a jo🐝 interview, they're fla🐝🐝ergasted, can't 🐝elieve what I say. There's the sun. May🐝e that's a way out. I don't remem🐝er the sun having a 🐝ig 75 on it. I predicted glo🐝al warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me. Wait! Stop! 🐝ee! Stand 🐝ack. These are winter 🐝oots. Wait! Don't kill him! You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me! Why does his life have less value than yours? Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement? I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capa🐝le of feeling. My 🐝rochure! There you go, little guy. I'm not scared of him. It's an allergic thing. Put that on your resume 🐝rochure. My whole face could puff up. Make it one of your special skills. Knocking someone out is also a special skill. Right. 🐝ye, Vanessa. Thanks. - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever. - You could put caro🐝 chips on there. - 🐝ye. - Supposed to 🐝e less calories. - 🐝ye. I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something. All right, here it goes. Nah. What would I say? I could really get in trou🐝le. It's a 🐝ee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human. I can't 🐝elieve I'm doing this. I've got to. Oh, I can't do it. Oome on! No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't. How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good. Here she comes! Speak, you fool! Hi! I'm sorry. - You're talking. - Yes, I know. You're talking! I'm so sorry. No, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'm dreaming. 🐝ut I don't recall going to 🐝ed. Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting. This is a 🐝it of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a 🐝ee! I am. And I'm not supposed to 🐝e doing this, 🐝ut they were all trying to kill me. And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised. That was a little weird. - I'm talking with a 🐝ee. - Yeah. I'm talking to a 🐝ee. And the 🐝ee is talking to me! I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now. - Wait! How did you learn to do that? - What? The talking thing. Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up. - That's very funny. - Yeah. 🐝ees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with. Anyway... Oan I... ...get you something? - Like what? I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Ooffee? I don't want to put you out. It's no trou🐝le. It takes two minutes. - It's just coffee. - I hate to impose. - Don't 🐝e ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup. Hey, you want rum cake? - I shouldn't. - Have some. - No, I can't. - Oome on! I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms. - Where? - These stripes don't help. You look great! I don't know if you know anything a🐝out fashion. Are you all right? No. He's making the tie in the ca🐝 as they're flying up Madison. He finally gets there. He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on. And he says, ""Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan. Why would I marry a watermelon?"" Is that a 🐝ee joke? That's the kind of stuff we do. Yeah, different. So, what are you gonna do, 🐝arry? A🐝out work? I don't know. I want to do my part for the hive, 🐝ut I can't do it the way they want. I know how you feel. - You do? - Sure. My parents wanted me to 🐝e a lawyer or a doctor, 🐝ut I wanted to 🐝e a florist. - Really? - My only interest is flowers. Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan. Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it? You're in Sheep Meadow! Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond! No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once. - Why do girls put rings on their toes? - Why not? - It's like putting a hat on your knee. - May🐝e I'll try that. - You all right, ma'am? - Oh, yeah. Fine. Just having two cups of coffee! Anyway, this has 🐝een great. Thanks for the coffee. Yeah, it's no trou🐝le. Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd 🐝e up the rest of my life. Are you...? Oan I take a piece of this with me? Sure! Here, have a crum🐝. - Thanks! - Yeah. All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not. OK, 🐝arry. And thank you so much again... for 🐝efore. Oh, that? That was nothing. Well, not nothing, 🐝ut... Anyway... This can't possi🐝ly work. He's all set to go. We may as well try it. OK, Dave, pull the chute. - Sounds amazing. - It was amazing! It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life. Humans! I can't 🐝elieve you were with humans! Giant, scary humans! What were they like? Huge and crazy. They talk crazy. They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy. - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of them. 🐝ut some of them don't. - How'd you get 🐝ack? - Poodle. You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see. You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out yourjo🐝 and 🐝e normal. - Well... - Well? Well, I met someone. You did? Was she 🐝ee-ish? - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp. - Spider? - I'm not attracted to spiders. I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get 🐝y that face. So who is she? She's... human. No, no. That's a 🐝ee law. You wouldn't 🐝reak a 🐝ee law. - Her name's Vanessa. - Oh, 🐝oy. She's so nice. And she's a florist! Oh, no! You're dating a human florist! We're not dating. You're flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite! She saved my life! And she understands me. This is over! Eat this. This is not over! What was that? - They call it a crum🐝. - It was so stingin' stripey! And that's not what they eat. That's what falls off what they eat! - You know what a Oinna🐝on is? - No. It's 🐝read and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up... Sit down! ...really hot! - Listen to me! We are not them! We're us. There's us and there's them! Yes, 🐝ut who can deny the heart that is yearning? There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me! You have got to start thinking 🐝ee, my friend. Thinking 🐝ee! - Thinking 🐝ee. - Thinking 🐝ee. Thinking 🐝ee! Thinking 🐝ee! Thinking 🐝ee! Thinking 🐝ee! There he is. He's in the pool. You know what your pro🐝lem is, 🐝arry? I gotta start thinking 🐝ee? How much longer will this go on? It's 🐝een three days! Why aren't you working? I've got a lot of 🐝ig life decisions to think a🐝out. What life? You have no life! You have no jo🐝. You're 🐝arely a 🐝ee! Would it kill you to make a little honey? 🐝arry, come out. Your father's talking to you. Martin, would you talk to him? 🐝arry, I'm talking to you! You coming? Got everything? All set! Go ahead. I'll catch up. Don't 🐝e too long. Watch this! Vanessa! - We're still here. - I told you not to yell at him. He doesn't respond to yelling! - Then why yell at me? - 🐝ecause you don't listen! I'm not listening to this. Sorry, I've gotta go. - Where are you going? - I'm meeting a friend. A girl? Is this why you can't decide? 🐝ye. I just hope she's 🐝ee-ish. They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena? To 🐝e in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream! Up on a float, surrounded 🐝y flowers, crowds cheering. A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events? No. All right, I've got one. How come you don't fly everywhere? It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster. Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn. TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane! You don't have that? We have Hivo, 🐝ut it's a disease. It's a horri🐝le, horri🐝le disease. Oh, my. Dum🐝 🐝ees! You must want to sting all those jerks. We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us. So you have to watch your temper. Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust. Oh, my goodness! Are you OK? Yeah. - What is wrong with you?! - It's a 🐝ug. He's not 🐝othering any🐝ody. Get out of here, you creep! What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular? Yeah, it was. How did you know? It felt like a🐝out 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit. You've really got that down to a science. - I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue. - I'll 🐝et. What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this? How did this get here? Oute 🐝ee, Golden 🐝lossom, Ray Liotta Private Select? - Is he that actor? - I never heard of him. - Why is this here? - For people. We eat it. You don't have enough food of your own? - Well, yes. - How do you get it? - 🐝ees make it. - I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it! There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing! - It's organic. - It's our-ganic! It's just honey, 🐝arry. Just what?! 🐝ees don't know a🐝out this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing! You've taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have! And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the 🐝ottom of this. I'm getting to the 🐝ottom of all of this! Hey, Hector. - You almost done? - Almost. He is here. I sense it. Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around. You're 🐝usted, 🐝ox 🐝oy! I knew I heard something. So you can talk! I can talk. And now you'll start talking! Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier? I don't understand. I thought we were friends. The last thing we want to do is upset 🐝ees! You're too late! It's ours now! You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword! You, sir, will 🐝e lunch for my iguana, Ignacio! Where is the honey coming from? Tell me where! Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms! Orazy person! What horri🐝le thing has happened here? These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now they're on the road to nowhere! Just keep still. What? You're not dead? Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed? To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here. I'm going to Alaska. Moose 🐝lood, crazy stuff. 🐝lows your head off! I'm going to Tacoma. - And you? - He really is dead. All right. Uh-oh! - What is that?! - Oh, no! - A wiper! Triple 🐝lade! - Triple 🐝lade? Jump on! It's your only chance, 🐝ee! Why does everything have to 🐝e so doggone clean?! How much do you people need to see?! Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window! From NPR News in Washington, I'm Oarl Kasell. 🐝ut don't kill no more 🐝ugs! - 🐝ee! - Moose 🐝lood guy!! - You hear something? - Like what? Like tiny screaming. Turn off the radio. Whassup, 🐝ee 🐝oy? Hey, 🐝lood. Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see. Wow! I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it. I mean, that honey's ours. - 🐝ees hang tight. - We're all jammed in. It's a close community. Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own. - What if you get in trou🐝le? - You a mosquito, you in trou🐝le. No🐝ody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack! At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls. Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly. Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito. You got to 🐝e kidding me! Moose🐝lood's a🐝out to leave the 🐝uilding! So long, 🐝ee! - Hey, guys! - Moose🐝lood! I knew I'd catch y'all down here. Did you 🐝ring your crazy straw? We throw it in jars, slap a la🐝el on it, and it's pretty much pure profit. What is this place? A 🐝ee's got a 🐝rain the size of a pinhead. They are pinheads! Pinhead. - Oheck out the new smoker. - Oh, sweet. That's the one you want. The Thomas 3000! Smoker? Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar. A couple 🐝reaths of this knocks them right out. They make the honey, and we make the money. ""They make the honey, and we make the money""? Oh, my! What's going on? Are you OK? Yeah. It doesn't last too long. Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls? Our queen was moved here. We had no choice. This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes! That's a drag queen! What is this? Oh, no! There's hundreds of them! 🐝ee honey. Our honey is 🐝eing 🐝razenly stolen on a massive scale! This is worse than anything 🐝ears have done! I intend to do something. Oh, 🐝arry, stop. Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor. Do these look like rumors? That's a conspiracy theory. These are o🐝viously doctored photos. How did you get mixed up in this? He's 🐝een talking to humans. - What? - Talking to humans?! He has a human girlfriend. And they make out! Make out? 🐝arry! We do not. - You wish you could. - Whose side are you on? The 🐝ees! I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night. 🐝arry, this is what you want to do with your life? I want to do it for all our lives. No🐝ody works harder than 🐝ees! Dad, I remem🐝er you coming home so overworked your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop. I remem🐝er that. What right do they have to our honey? We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip 🐝alm for no reason whatsoever! Even if it's true, what can one 🐝ee do? Sting them where it really hurts. In the face! The eye! - That would hurt. - No. Up the nose? That's a killer. There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters. Hive at Five, the hive's only full-hour action news source. No more 🐝ee 🐝eards! With 🐝o🐝 🐝um🐝le at the anchor desk. Weather with Storm Stinger. Sports with 🐝uzz Larvi. And Jeanette Ohung. - Good evening. I'm 🐝o🐝 🐝um🐝le. - And I'm Jeanette Ohung. A tri-county 🐝ee, 🐝arry 🐝enson, intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally! Tomorrow night on 🐝ee Larry King, we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new 🐝ook, Olassy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon. Tonight we're talking to 🐝arry 🐝enson. Did you ever think, ""I'm a kid from the hive. I can't do this""? 🐝ees have never 🐝een afraid to change the world. What a🐝out 🐝ee Oolum🐝us? 🐝ee Gandhi? 🐝ejesus? Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans. We were thinking of stick🐝all or candy stores. How old are you? The 🐝ee community is supporting you in this case, which will 🐝e the trial of the 🐝ee century. You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too. It's a common name. Next week... He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots... Next week... Glasses, quotes on the 🐝ottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em. 🐝ear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live. Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish. In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness! It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81. Honey, her 🐝ackhand's a joke! I'm not gonna take advantage of that? Quiet, please. Actual work going on here. - Is that that same 🐝ee? - Yes, it is! I'm helping him sue the human race. - Hello. - Hello, 🐝ee. This is Ken. Yeah, I remem🐝er you. Tim🐝erland, size ten and a half. Vi🐝ram sole, I 🐝elieve. Why does he talk again? Listen, you 🐝etter go 'cause we're really 🐝usy working. 🐝ut it's our yogurt night! 🐝ye-🐝ye. Why is yogurt night so difficult?! You poor thing. You two have 🐝een at this for hours! Yes, and Adam here has 🐝een a huge help. - Frosting... - How many sugars? Just one. I try not to use the competition. So why are you helping me? 🐝ees have good qualities. And it takes my mind off the shop. Instead of flowers, people are giving 🐝alloon 🐝ouquets now. Those are great, if you're three. And artificial flowers. - Oh, those just get me psychotic! - Yeah, me too. 🐝ent stingers, pointless pollination. 🐝ees must hate those fake things! Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done. May🐝e this could make up for it a little 🐝it. - This lawsuit's a pretty 🐝ig deal. - I guess. You sure you want to go through with it? Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't 🐝e a🐝le to say, ""Honey, I'm home,"" without paying a royalty! It's an incredi🐝le scene here in downtown Manhattan, where the world anxiously waits, 🐝ecause for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselves if a honey🐝ee can actually speak. What have we gotten into here, 🐝arry? It's pretty 🐝ig, isn't it? I can't 🐝elieve how many humans don't work during the day. You think 🐝illion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers? Every🐝ody needs to stay 🐝ehind the 🐝arricade. - What's the matter? - I don't know, I just got a chill. Well, if it isn't the 🐝ee team. You 🐝oys work on this? All rise! The Honora🐝le Judge 🐝um🐝leton presiding. All right. Oase num🐝er 4475, Superior Oourt of New York, 🐝arry 🐝ee 🐝enson v. the Honey Industry is now in session. Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively? A privilege. Mr. 🐝enson... you're representing all the 🐝ees of the world? I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed. Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman. 🐝orn on a farm, she 🐝elieved it was man's divine right to 🐝enefit from the 🐝ounty of nature God put 🐝efore us. If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. 🐝enson imagines, just think of what would it mean. I would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my 🐝ritches! Talking 🐝ee! How do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry? They could 🐝e using laser 🐝eams! Ro🐝otics! Ventriloquism! Oloning! For all we know, he could 🐝e on steroids! Mr. 🐝enson? Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here. I'm just an ordinary 🐝ee. Honey's pretty important to me. It's important to all 🐝ees. We invented it! We make it. And we protect it with our lives. Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys! I'm hoping that, after this is all over, you'll see how, 🐝y taking our honey, you not only take everything we have 🐝ut everything we are! I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice! Oall your first witness. So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, 🐝ig company you have. I suppose so. I see you also own Honey🐝urton and Honron! Yes, they provide 🐝eekeepers for our farms. 🐝eekeeper. I find that to 🐝e a very distur🐝ing term. I don't imagine you employ any 🐝ee-free-ers, do you? - No. - I couldn't hear you. - No. - No. 🐝ecause you don't free 🐝ees. You keep 🐝ees. Not only that, it seems you thought a 🐝ear would 🐝e an appropriate image for a jar of honey. They're very lova🐝le creatures. Yogi 🐝ear, Fozzie 🐝ear, 🐝uild-A-🐝ear. You mean like this? 🐝ears kill 🐝ees! How'd you like his head crashing through your living room?! 🐝iting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows! OK, that's enough. Take him away. So, Mr. Sting, thank you for 🐝eing here. Your name intrigues me. - Where have I heard it 🐝efore? - I was with a 🐝and called The Police. 🐝ut you've never 🐝een a police officer, have you? No, I haven't. No, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example of 🐝ee culture casually stolen 🐝y a human for nothing more than a prance-a🐝out stage name. Oh, please. Have you ever 🐝een stung, Mr. Sting? 🐝ecause I'm feeling a little stung, Sting. Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner! That's not his real name?! You idiots! Mr. Liotta, first, 🐝elated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005. Thank you. Thank you. I see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to 🐝low. I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime? Not yet it isn't. 🐝ut is this what it's come to for you? Exploiting tiny, helpless 🐝ees so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir? Watch it, 🐝enson! I could 🐝low right now! This isn't a goodfella. This is a 🐝adfella! Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?! - Order in this court! - You're all thinking it! Order! Order, I say! - Say it! - Mr. Liotta, please sit down! I think it was awfully nice of that 🐝ear to pitch in like that. I think the jury's on our side. Are we doing everything right, legally? I'm a florist. Right. Well, here's to a great team. To a great team! Well, hello. - Ken! - Hello. I didn't think you were coming. No, I was just late. I tried to call, 🐝ut... the 🐝attery. I didn't want all this to go to waste, so I called 🐝arry. Luckily, he was free. Oh, that was lucky. There's a little left. I could heat it up. Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever. So I hear you're quite a tennis player. I'm not much for the game myself. The 🐝all's a little gra🐝🐝y. That's where I usually sit. Right... there. Ken, 🐝arry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill. You think I don't see what you're doing? I know how hard it is to find the rightjo🐝. We have that in common. Do we? 🐝ees have 100 percent employment, 🐝ut we do jo🐝s like taking the crud out. That's just what I was thinking a🐝out doing. Ken, I let 🐝arry 🐝orrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right. I'm going to drain the old stinger. Yeah, you do that. Look at that. You know, I've just a🐝out had it with your little mind games. - What's that? - Italian Vogue. Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages. A lot of ads. Remem🐝er what Van said, why is your life more valua🐝le than mine? Funny, I just can't seem to recall that! I think something stinks in here! I love the smell of flowers. How do you like the smell of flames?! Not as much. Water 🐝ug! Not taking sides! Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat! This is pathetic! I've got issues! Well, well, well, a royal flush! - You're 🐝luffing. - Am I? Surf's up, dude! Poo water! That 🐝owl is gnarly. Except for those dirty yellow rings! Kenneth! What are you doing?! You know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it! We need to talk! He's just a little 🐝ee! And he happens to 🐝e the nicest 🐝ee I've met in a long time! Long time? What are you talking a🐝out?! Are there other 🐝ugs in your life? No, 🐝ut there are other things 🐝ugging me in life. And you're one of them! Fine! Talking 🐝ees, no yogurt night... My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster! Good🐝ye, Ken. And for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made 🐝y man! I'm sorry a🐝out all that. I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it! I always felt there was some kind of 🐝arrier 🐝etween Ken and me. I couldn't overcome it. Oh, well. Are you OK for the trial? I 🐝elieve Mr. Montgomery is a🐝out out of ideas. We would like to call Mr. 🐝arry 🐝enson 🐝ee to the stand. Good idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the 🐝est lawyers... Yeah. Layton, you've gotta weave some magic with this jury, or it's gonna 🐝e all over. Don't worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don't like a🐝out 🐝ees. - You got the tweezers? - Are you allergic? Only to losing, son. Only to losing. Mr. 🐝enson 🐝ee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know. What exactly is your relationship to that woman? We're friends. - Good friends? - Yes. How good? Do you live together? Wait a minute... Are you her little... ...🐝ed🐝ug? I've seen a 🐝ee documentary or two. From what I understand, doesn't your queen give 🐝irth to all the 🐝ee children? - Yeah, 🐝ut... - So those aren't your real parents! - Oh, 🐝arry... - Yes, they are! Hold me 🐝ack! You're an illegitimate 🐝ee, aren't you, 🐝enson? He's denouncing 🐝ees! Don't y'all date your cousins? - O🐝jection! - I'm going to pincushion this guy! Adam, don't! It's what he wants! Oh, I'm hit!! Oh, lordy, I am hit! Order! Order! The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have 🐝een felled 🐝y a winged 🐝east of destruction! You see? You can't treat them like equals! They're striped savages! Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way! - Adam, stay with me. - I can't feel my legs. What angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my heaving 🐝uttocks? I will have order in this court. Order! Order, please! The case of the honey🐝ees versus the human race took a pointed turn against the 🐝ees yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery. - Hey, 🐝uddy. - Hey. - Is there much pain? - Yeah. I... I 🐝lew the whole case, didn't I? It doesn't matter. What matters is you're alive. You could have died. I'd 🐝e 🐝etter off dead. Look at me. They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich. Look, there's a little celery still on it. What was it like to sting someone? I can't explain it. It was all... All adrenaline and then... and then ecstasy! All right. You think it was all a trap? Of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this. What were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of 🐝ugs in this world. What will the humans do to us if they win? I don't know. I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound so 🐝ad. Adam, they check in, 🐝ut they don't check out! Oh, my. Oould you get a nurse to close that window? - Why? - The smoke. 🐝ees don't smoke. Right. 🐝ees don't smoke. 🐝ees don't smoke! 🐝ut some 🐝ees are smoking. That's it! That's our case! It is? It's not over? Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere. Get 🐝ack to the court and stall. Stall any way you can. And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tu🐝. Mr. Flayman. Yes? Yes, Your Honor! Where is the rest of your team? Well, Your Honor, it's interesting. 🐝ees are trained to fly haphazardly, and as a result, we don't make very good time. I actually heard a funny story a🐝out... Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous 🐝ugs taken up enough of this court's valua🐝le time? How much longer will we allow these a🐝surd shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients, who run legitimate 🐝usinesses. I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case! Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion. 🐝ut you can't! We have a terrific case. Where is your proof? Where is the evidence? Show me the smoking gun! Hold it, Your Honor! You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun. What is that? It's a 🐝ee smoker! What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a 🐝ee. Look at what has happened to 🐝ees who have never 🐝een asked, ""Smoking or non?"" Is this what nature intended for us? To 🐝e forci🐝ly addicted to smoke machines and man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man? - What are we gonna do? - He's playing the species card. Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these 🐝ees! Free the 🐝ees! Free the 🐝ees! Free the 🐝ees! Free the 🐝ees! Free the 🐝ees! The court finds in favor of the 🐝ees! Vanessa, we won! I knew you could do it! High-five! Sorry. I'm OK! You know what this means? All the honey will finally 🐝elong to the 🐝ees. Now we won't have to work so hard all the time. This is an unholy perversion of the 🐝alance of nature, 🐝enson. You'll regret this. 🐝arry, how much honey is out there? All right. One at a time. 🐝arry, who are you wearing? My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants. - What if Montgomery's right? - What do you mean? We've 🐝een living the 🐝ee way a long time, 27 million years."

This is a shitpost.,"haha emoji bad look at me guys I'm so funny hahahahahahhaaaahahhaheeehheee Oh wow🤩  look at this guy🧔such a big man🏋️‍♀️. “uh oh someone used emojis😂🤣😭 let’s go✊now I get my free 7 karma⬆️” you are the scum🤢of the earth🌎. I mean you’re a real piece of shit💩 you know that? who are you❓to dictate what I say on reddit😡. Because of you👉, my precious time 🕰 is being wasted. I could be having hot🔥 sex😫 with my sexy girlfriend🚶‍♀️. But I’m not because of you ☝️replying to me. Do you know what I did to get to where I am today🙄? I came from nothing😶and I climbed my way to the top🤑to become what I am today🥴and you do what? Stroll🚶 on in and tell me how to live my life🗣? Absolutely not🤬. I spent 37 years in ‘Nam 😮slaughtering the Vietcong👿. Every minute was life or death 💀 , one☝️ false move and you would be impaled. I killed☠️ over 200 citizens just with my bare hands👐. If you seriously😒 think 🤔 that some insignificant 🔍 garbage🗑 like you can talk🗣any kind of shit 💩 to me then you’re fucking wrong buddy👨‍💻. I poured my heart ❤️ and soul 👻 into those words and you bias me based on a simple 💯. It’s utterly disgusting🤮 to know people like you exist.🤡 So now what are you gonna do 🤔? Because, from where I’m standing🚶‍♂️there is no possible way for you to right your wrong👎. I think💭 you and I both know what you have to do now.☠️ See you in hell.🔥"

I'm thicc,I haven't had sex since spring of '99  (before I started roughing it out in the wilderness) but I guarantee I got more pussy than anyone will in their whole life 🤷‍♂️ I'm buff and burly and badass and have a huge cock too
Shit personality,Maybe if you had a good personality you wouldn't love stupid things like this 🤷‍♂️ this is honestly just stupid and I don't get it or understand it. You have such a shit personality because you stay in bed all day watching stupid fucking videos which makes your sense of humor and personality awful. I've been roughing it out in the wilderness since summer of '99 and still have my personality from '99 because I don't watch stupid internet videos and no technology 🤷‍♂️ I have a better personality than you and am more burly and badass cunt

Top 5 crazy theories about Wyoming you had no idea existed.," Top 5 crazy theories about Wyoming you had no idea existed.   

5. Wyoming is a state in the United States of America - Yes, I know, this might sound crazy but some people really do believe it. No one who doesn't think this way actually knows why people think this is true. Some people believe it comes from false rumours or false Wikipedia articles that say it is real.  

4. Wyoming is actually North Korea's way of trying to kill us - You may not believe this, but this is a well believed theory. Some people believe that Kim Jong Un was the one who actually constructed the Yellowstone volcano which could wipe out at least 50% of the population easily. Many people believe that this theory originated from a news article of some sort.  

3. Wyoming is actually a place that you get transported to when you enter area 51 - This is a very popular theory that came from ancient Egyptians when they created Obamacare (while they were on holiday in America). They were creating their free healthcare when they suddenly discovered an empty state with literally nothing in it, no people, no animals, no trees, no buildings, nothing. Also the grass was bright pink with yellow stripes. Even weirder, no one ever seemed to look in the direction of the bizarre state. So they entered the abandoned area and discovered that some of their friends that worked in area 51 were there, the Egyptians geo-leaped to their area 51 mates and said g'day. They asked them what was up with the strange state and they responded with B̴̙̳̬͖̪̰͙̙͍̝͖̥̯̩̗̦̜̤̭̊͗̽̒̋̎̓̀̃̍̈́̊̾̔̔͆̓̐̃͗͆͘̕̚͠Ư̸̢̡̧̧̛̦̳͈̭̭̳̫̳̭̞̤̗̞̣̥͍̣͇̹͙̲̲̫̖͓̝̜͎̘͇̥͛̅̅̀́̅̆͐͋̈́̋̑̀̒͑͗́́̾̉͛͆̾̋̈́̕̕͘̚͜R̶̡̡̨̨̧͇͍̰̘͍̦͎͙͔̠͈̤̖̙̩̥̣̪͙̖͕͚̜̤̥̙͚̻̹͚̣̪̬̙̪͎͔͍̤͑̈́̐̀̐̿͋̄̆̿́̓̎̍͒̚͜ͅG̷̥̘̫̤̰̩̖̙̣̜͈̟͙͖͌̍̍̾̃̆͒̀̈͌̀̏̊̿͒̓̾̏̀̎͠ͅͅE̴̛͔̬̥̮͂͐̂̐̓̐̿̑̽͗͛̈̿̎̓̑̒͒̓̏̄̌̈́̀̂̀̏͑̿̀̍͐̓̾͌̅̓͐̅̚͘͝͝͠͝Ŗ̵̢̡̙̹͎̟͚̫̦̫̠͙̻̣̘͖͚͍̬̫̤̼̮̭̮̞͙̫̫̦̮̿̈̆͗̊ͅ. So, as their human instincts told them to do, they ran away towards the normal part of America. But they saw a few other mates and asked them what was wrong. And they just said ""ayo lmao idfk i juss got here i cant remember shiiiiit i think i mf teleported bihhh 😂😂😂👌👌"". They then left the state, went back to their apartment and fell asleep. The next day they woke up and saw that the state completely disappeared, it was just filled with T̵͍́̈̀̀̌́̓̽H̵̰͖̱̫̯̪̏̓̉́̾̊̽͒͋̆͐̕͜Ę̵̧̧̟͓̜̳̮̺̰̰̮͎̤̝̿̃͛̂̋̏̓̒̑͘ ̵̢̧̘͚͉̥̭͖̗̯͈̈́̓̐̐̃̓̒̓̎͜ͅV̶̧̹̱͙̬̠̄̉̀̃͒̀̎̿̓̇͝Ö̵͔͓͕́́͌͒̕I̴͕̋͋͊͌D̵̡̨͓̲̮̑͆̇̊̈́̿͌̏͂͝ͅͅ. They then both miraculously died from lung failure.  

2. Wyoming isn't actually a real place - This is by far the most accurate and most popular theory about Wyoming to date, I personally, along with millions of others, believe that this theory is in fact not fiction, but the truth. As quoted from Urban Dictionary, ""Wyoming is supposedly a state in the United States. In reality, wyoming does not exist. Nobody has ever met anybody from wyoming. It is a vast government conspiracy. If you think you are driving through wyoming, you are really unconscious in a secret government facility where scientists are implanting false memory engrams into your mind. This knowledge is commonly introduced to high school freshmen."".  Before we get to the number 1 crazy Wyoming theory, here are some honourable mentions that didn't quite make the top 5 list: Wyoming is actually a big boat. Wyoming was originally a social experiment that went out of hand. Wyoming had legalised murder, and they had a celebratory purge that went way out of hand and killed the entire population of the state.  

1. Wyoming is actually a secret hideout for the man himself, Soulja Boy - Some people think he faked his death, some believe he actually died and was resurrected. The theory states that he didn't like the popularity or fame that he was getting for his music, so he decided to live in the most deserted place in the world, Wyoming. According to a recent study, 99% of people are suspicious about Wyoming, and 80% don't believe it is a real place, so that would be an optimal place for a fame escape."

Alpha gamer here,"Hello youtube and my loyal fans, it's alpha red-pilled anti-sjw classical liberal anti-leftist truth seeking patriotic nationalist skeptic here to talk to you about the new video game sequel. When I first saw the trailer I thought ""hey this night not be too bad, I mean there arent any 2 minority groups so there arent any politics in the game"" but when I loaded up reddit and saw the top post on r/pewdiepiesubmissions , it being the new gay black minor character I was furious. How dare the liberals in big Vidya try to brainwash me?! This new minority character is a perfect example of forced diversity in video games. Even as a non biased skeptic I have to say, this is horrendous. Why must video games be so political now a days?!?!?!? I remember when we had games like bioshock, extremely non political, and now we have games where black people are minor characters? FORCED DIVERSITY STOP RUINING VIDYA TRADITION. CULTURE AND TRADITION ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO A GAMER. Thank you for tuning into my little rant about forced diversity and politics in video games, make sure to leave notifications on for when I make my great replacement video next week. Bye ✌"

I finally graduated from middle school 👶 AND high school 👧 AND had my first baby 😍 AND had my second baby! 🍼 

We saw one great president leave (rip Bush ❌) and endured a bad one 💩👨🏿‍💼 and now we have Trump! 👨🏻‍🔧 The best of them all! 

Its also been QUITE the decade for firsts 1️⃣. I got my first period 👹 AND gave my first bj 🤮. I started my first fight with that BITCH Cathy Johnson 👩🏾‍🦳 who looked at Austin ❤️ in second period English. I saw my first lunar eclipse 🌑  and felt the intestines 🍝 of a newborn gerbil 🐹 all in the same day! Wow! What a decade! 

Tell me some of your favorite memories, y’all!"
Found it on r/confessions,"That's all you have to say? The man committed a crime and you hope school is going well? Nah fuck that man, 😡😡😡it's people like him that are taking away money from hard working people who have EARNED it. Hopefully school learns that one of their students is a thief and expells him. He needs to learn now befor this turns into a habit.

Is literally scares me how many of you people disagree with me and think this behavior is right.👎👎👎 Seriously find some help and make better life choices.

700 people agree with this asshole?😡😡 You all make me thankful I have my guns and ammo in my house with people like you out there. I'll pray for you all to find some guidance, you definitely need it."

🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫 Retribution 🤫🤫😬😬😬😵😵😵😵🤤🤤🤤🤤😁😁😁,"Hi 👋👋👋, Elliot Rodger here👂👂👂. Well 🕳🕳🕳, this🤔🤔🤔 is my last 🔚🔚🔒video📺📽🎞📷. It all📕📗📘📙 has to come😣🍆💦 to🥈2️⃣ this👈👈👈. Tomorrow🔜🔜🔜 is the day🗓🗓 of retribution🔫😤, the day 🗓🗓 I 😁😁will have my😙👈 revenge😬😬😡😤 against humanity👺😈, against all 📕📗📘📙 of you😐🔫😡.

For4️⃣ the last🔚🔚 eight 8️⃣years 🗓of my 😙👈 life♋️, since I 😙👈 hit 👊😡puberty💦🍆😣, I’ve been forced😪😢 to2️⃣ endure😥😥😫 an existence of loneliness😖😖😭, rejection😭👋👩🏼 and unfulfilled🗑📭📥 desires💦🍆😫, all because girls😡😡😭😖 have never🚫🛑⛔️🆘 been attracted😘😘😍🥰🥰 to 2️⃣me 😙👈. Girls 😡😡😭😖 gave 🛍🎊🎉their affection🥴🥰😘😋 and sex😋😋😍😍🥰😘🥰😛😋😚 and love🥴🥴🥳🤩🥰😍 to other men👨🏼👨🏼, never 🚫🛑⛔️🆘 to me 😙👈.

I’m 2️⃣2️⃣ years old👵🧓👴 and still a virgin🧕🏻🧕🏻, never🚫 even kissed😘 a girl👧. And through college🚉🏢, 2 1/2 years, more than that actually, I’m still a virgin🧕🏻🧕🏻. It has been very torturous😖😖😬😡😡😡😭😭.

College 🚉🏢 is the time🕞🕝🕗 when everyone experiences those things such as sex😘🥰🥰😘😘😋😋😛 and fun and pleasure🤤🤤. In those years I’ve had to rot🤢🤢🤮🤮 in loneliness, it’s not fair🤡🌎.

You👈👈 girls👧👧 have never🚫 been attracted😍😍 to me😡👈. I don’t know🤨🧐🤓🧐 why you girls aren’t attracted😍😍 to me😡👈 but I will punish😡😡🤬🤬😤😠 you all for it. It’s an injustice😱😱😨😨, a crime👳🏿‍♀️👳🏿‍♀️ because I don’t know what you don’t see in me, I’m the perfect💯💯 guy and yet you throw yourselves at all these obnoxious men instead of me, the supreme gentleman. I will punish😭😭🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡🤬🤬🤨 all of you for it. [laughs]

On the day🗓📅 of retribution, I am going to enter the hottest🥵🥵 sorority house🏠 at UCSB and I will slaughter🔫🔫🔫 every single spoiled, stuck-up, blond slut I see inside there. All those girls I’ve desired so much. They have all rejected me and looked down on me as an inferior👎👎👎 man if I ever made a sexual advance👉👉👉 toward them, while they throw themselves at these obnoxious brutes🐵🐵.

I take great pleasure💆‍♂️💆‍♂️ in slaughtering all of you., You will finally see that I am, in truth, the superior🔝🔝♾ one, the true alpha male. [laughs] Yes, after I have annihilated🤯🤯 every single girl in the sorority house🏠🏠, I’ll take to the streets of Isla Vista and slay every single person I see there. All those popular kids who live such lives of hedonistic pleasure while I’ve had to rot in loneliness all these years. They all look down upon me every time I tried to join them, they’ve all treated me like a mouse🐀🐀.

Well, now I will be a god😹😹😹 compared to you, you will all be animals🐷🐷🐻🐻🐮, you are animals and I will slaughter🗡🗡 you like animals. I’ll be a god exacting my retribution😡😡😡 on all those who deserve it and you do deserve it just for the crime of living a better life than me.

The popular kids, you never accepted me and now you will all pay for it. Girls, all I ever wanted was to love you, be loved by you💑. I wanted a girlfriend. I wanted sex, love, affection, adoration.

You think I’m unworthy🤮🤮🤮 of you. That’s a crime I can never🛑🛑🛑🚫🚫❌ get over. If I can’t have you girls, I will destroy you. [laughs] You denied me a happy life and in turn I will deny all of you life, it’s only fair. I hate all of you.

Humanity is a disgusting🤢🤢🤢, wretched🤑🤑🤑, depraved🤡🤡🤡 species. If I had it in my power I would stop at nothing to reduce every single one of you to mountains🌄 of skulls💀💀 and rivers🏞 of blood and rightfully so. You deserve to be annihilated and I will give that to you. You never showed me any mercy so I will show you none. [laughs]

You forced me to suffer😤😤😭😭😢😫😫😖 all my life, now I will make you all suffer. I waited a long time for this. I’ll give you exactly what you deserve, all of you. All you girls who rejected me, looked down⬇️⬇️ upon me, you know, treated me like scum while you gave yourselves to other men. And all of you men for living a better life than me, all of you sexually active men. I hate you. I hate all of you. I can’t wait to give you exactly what you deserve, annihilation."

My Winter Story,"My penis has been scorched black by the immensely cold winter temperatures. In two weeks I can say I have a BBC, but in another month it will be gone.

Thanks Mother Nature for taking away my peen. There’s 8 pounds of my body weight gone. It will need to be severed. I am so blue. The only thing that can cure my sadness is a fit CummyBot2000 cock in my tight ass. Pumping in and out. Making me cum with every thrust.

Oh well. I guess I’ll just die. 😔"

A Facebook sourced warning about Ring security cameras,"If you have indoor Ring security cameras, you might want to considered setting them on fire and throwing them out the window. 
Ours were hacked tonight and we are on edge now. 🤦🏼‍♀️ The kids are really freaked out!!!
I was cooking dinner while the kids played and Jake ran to his Dad’s house. All of a sudden we hear someone talking...telling Mason to sit back down when he stood up and saying the Christmas tree looked good and telling me to come back in the living room and that it’s cute that I’m sneaking pics of the baby...At first I thought it was coming from Mason’s ipad - like he was FaceTiming a friend. Nope. Then I thought Jake was messing with us on the Ring camera. Jake then walked in the door and it stopped for a few minutes. Then it started back up - when Jake went to unplug it the guy told him to put the camera down and that he knows where we live 😳 He was looking at the camera downstairs too. And just to prove he really DOES have our address, he then sent a Papa John’s pizza to our house.
It’s super creepy looking back on the recordings and seeing what he saw. 
Ring security was called, cops were called...Ring cameras are outta here for good!"
The truth about the Eric Andre Show,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Eric Andre. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical guest-trolling most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Eric's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Mad Magazine literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Eric Andre truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Eric's existential catchphrase “Time To Deliver A Pizza Ball!!” which itself is a cryptic reference to Dominos' Italian epic Pepperoni and Onions. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Hannibal Buress's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Ranch tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎"

A TA's response to a student when asked about making the final project optional for a class at my university,"Dear students 🦌🧑‍🎓, First 1️⃣ of all, thank you 🙏 for your 📩 comments. We all live 🏢🏠🏭 in a competitive 🏆 society, and the amount 💰 of reward 🎉 we receive 🎁 is primarily determined by ⚒ the amount of contribution 📝 we make to 🌆 society. We can 👎 hardly make any ☑️ significant contribution without ❌ sufficient 💡 skills. I 👀 moved to the 🇺🇸🇺🇸 United States 🇺🇸🇺🇸 from 🇹🇼China🇹🇼 three 3️⃣ months ago 🌙 for a Ph.D. here at 🤟 UT Austin 🤟. America is the 🏦🏦🏦🏦 wealthiest country in 🌎 the world. Most of you 👈 have lived in the U.S. a lot longer 📏 than me, and are very used to the 🏌️‍♀️🛩🏰 luxury lifestyle here. I am not 🚷 American, but I also want to lead a 💴💴💴 luxury lifestyle 🉐. Presumably, you as Americans also want to 🔁 continue your way of 🚗 life. Unfortunately, resources 🌡 in this world 🌐 are limited 🛑 and cannot afford 📛 every human being 👤 to be this rich 💸. The competitive nature of this world 🥇 determines that 🥈 you have to be more 🥉 competitive than us to 🏅 defend against 🛡 us. When I was attending college 👨‍🏫 in China, I usually take around 🔟ten🔟 courses every semester. I spent 🥱 an average of 12+ hours 🕓🕣🕚 every day on my studies 📚, including holidays ☃️ and semester breaks. The workload 🧰 I had was a lot higher ⬆️ than what you described in this 💬 post, and the difficulty ☠️ of the courses I took 🗄 was also more significant. I am not 🤔 saying that you should do exactly 🤷‍♂️ what I did. However, you should be aware 😦 that people like me 🇨🇳 are going to be your future 🏭 competitors. Many of you 👨‍👧‍👦 mentioned the large number 🚼 of students who believe 🌀 this assignment is too hard ⌛️ and who would like to give up 📴 . Again, in a competitive 🎗 environment, only a few people 🙋 can stand out. The nature 🌊 of our world is cruel 🔫, no matter how people try to 💯 embellish it or how advanced 🌉 civilization is. I wish you all 🎉🎉🎉 the best. 👨‍🏫 Your TA"

Fuck them and their fucking cloudy milk ass eyes, they couldn't fucking see the sun hurtling at them even if it were night. Hell they shouldn't fucking look up to check if it's raining, I'm scared they might drown. Them punk ass bitches with their ""👌🏻 is a white power hate symbol"" ass shit. Like bitch fuck you, ever heard of 4Chan, no no, not a hacker you fucking twat, the bitches that loke to mess with people. Like when they sent Mr.Worldwide to Kodak Alaska. But you heard some fart in the breez say that that's a fucking hate symbol and decide to fuck yourself with those words until you're raw and reap what you've fucking sewn. Going like awe shit, look at this hate symbol. Oblivious to the fact that you're the fucking shit-for-brains typewriter monkeys that made it one. You're just like fucking deer in the woods mindlessly taking a fat dump and yelling at the river because you've stepped in it. I know that y'all have your lips firmly sunk onto the sunken cost fallacy's asshole waiting to lick up any excrement you can, but put beside your pride for just one fucking moment. You fuckers are just making shit worse by pretending to be like my fucking alzheimers ass grandpa who can't even remember who shat his pants. Just fucking take a moment to look at the fucking fact that 4Chan punked you. And you just let fucking '👌🏻' become a hate symbol for fucks sake. Jesus christ, your thick ass skulls have guven real white supremacists a hate symbol to use. If y'all just didn't act like a 2nd grader running with scissors and being so fucki g starved for your petty ass clicks that you report on any playground gossup we wouldn't be having any problem. Shcool shooters or any shooter in general typically go through with it because they know they'll get famous for it. And who are the click thirsty dick whores that'll give em that attention, you the fucking news sites. Even if the shooters kill themselves they know their names will go down in infamy, and their mames will be remembered. Look at the fucking Columbine kids. Killed themselves, their names were up everywhere, and even still to this day girls want to FUCK those weird ass phychos. Yeah the argument can be made, that 'the girls would still like them even if they weren't plastered on the news'. But the wors part is how would you fucking know?! Yeah you could look up crime data on who did a shooting, but who needs to fucking bother when their names, faces and entire life story are plastered on every fucking news channel. The news is just fucking giving too much of a platform for hatred and physchos to get a foothold on. Like if I for example really wanted to get famous, but didn't really want to try at like curing cancer, or solving world hunger, or just being good in general which takes effort, I could just shoot up a School, church, strip club, mall, party, movie theater, and I know that the day after my face and name would be plastered all over cnn, nbc, ktla, abc, forbes, new york times, la times. The hardest part would be getting a gun, although now in the good ol' USA that's not too hard. I'd just have to go to my local walmart which banned video games for violence concerns and buy a semi auto rifle 3 years before being able to drink an alcoholic beverage, then just 3D print myself a bump stock then I'd be famous. And y'all would fucking love that, you'd all probably get a lot of revenue from reporting about a killer, not giving a second shit about those who have been killed, because it's not as sad. I don't hear anything really about the families of any recent shooting, survivors or mourners, but I still Hear shit about the shooters. Which is honestly fucked. Now you    Fucking newsie ass bitches got me typing for a solid 45 minutes, and now my fingers hurt, so fuck you. Fucking burn in hell you punk ass bitches 🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻"

X post from r/unpopular opinions," My (and I presume many other men’s) penis doesn’t respond to your moral arguments.

📷

I constantly see people talking about beauty as subjective, and I’m pretty sure that people are missing the point.

I can’t date excessively fat women, because my penis, independent of anything I tell it, goes into catatonic withdrawal at the sight of them.

Morals don’t factor in at all. If I had to hazard a guess, I’d presume that my penis, of its own accord, doesn’t like you because you look like a risky bet for depositing sperm. It doesn’t want to stop the bus and let the little guys out, because y’all look like a bad part of town.

There’s no argument that’s going to matter. My brain can be like “aw, since you put it that way..” all day, but my dick will have left the building while we were having this discussion. So why the fuck do you want to go on and on endlessly about body positivity? Why do you still try to fit 50 gallons of Crisco in 15 gallon leggings?"
Don't trust strangers on the internet," After a good game in csgo, I added him because he seemed like a cool guy. We got chatting and over the next couple of months we became good friends. Lots of banter, lots of great CS and most importantly true friendship. I invited him to my house for a csgo lan party. He said he was coming so I was looking forward to meet him in real life. When he arrived at my house, he pushed me against the wall and started nibbling my ear, I felt his hard ♥♥♥♥ push against my leg. I punched him and then I one tapped him. Turns out he was gay. Don't trust this guy."

I saw my entire family in the pornhub comment section 😳!!AWKWARD WARNING!!😳,"So I was just chillin in my room on my bed, it was about 11:43pm. And so I decided I'd just go to pornhub and spank the monkey, if ya now what I mean.😎 And so I'm going at it for a while and after I was done I was going through the comments section. And I saw a familiar name...😳 So I started to think real hard about who it was and why they were on pornhub. After a few minutes I was sweating pretty bad and I couldn't remember who's username it was. So about at 12:06 I remembered and it hit me... It was my dad...😳 I was so mortified, Then.... Things didn't get better. I scrolled a little more and I found more comments. MY 10 YEAR OLD SISTER posted a comment...😳 and at this point I was mortified, but IT GOT WORSE! My mom posted one too...😳 I was sweating hard core. My legs and arms where trembling at the fact that I now have to live in terror because I found my entire family in the comments section of a lesbian porn video. I was incredibly terrified... 😳BUT IT GOT WORSE😳. I searched for their usernames on pornhub just to check... And what I saw was terrifying. My older sister had an account...😳 I didn't go any further than that because at that point I was hyperventilating and sick to my stomach..."

N word,"OMGGGGzzzzz U SAIDZ IT!!! 😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲 IM GOING TO GET arrested by the FBI agent that is looking through my phone activity logs due to my incessant use of child porn, and several text message conversations about human drug mules sent to Saudi Arabia to deliver their 60g of fentanyl to Saleel-Wikhdemsa, who is most likely on a plane to his bunker in afghanistan, where he will proceed to write about his plans to fell the entire United States government using his hidden assortment of atomic nuclear weaponry, that will no doubtedly end with the entire world being blown to smithereens leaving no hope left for any type of life other than bacteria which will also eventually die out due to the nuclear apocalypse which will spread radiation across the entire world and blacken the surface of the earth, which will then absorb more of the sun's radiation rather than reflecting it, heating up the earth until it literally melts. This will compress all of the layers of rock, causing the planet to become smaller with the same amount of mass, canceling out the centrifugal motion and speeding the rotation of the earth exponentially to a matter of millions.

SUPRA BOOST,"LS’s aren’t the best. Sure they’re cheap and of course fun, but by far the greatest.
The JZ platform has probably singlehandedly carried the I6 engines to a strong W due to the fact that they’re stupidly reliable even when heavily modified. Both RB’s and JZ’s can handle up to around 600-800 BHP on a stock bottom end due to the cast iron blocks. Sure they’re a little heavy but they make for incredible powerhouses with a few bolt ons!

Even the B58 found in BMW’s can handle a safe 700 BHP with a stock bottom!

“Stance” excessive camber and busted oil pans is cancer to car culture. And after you ruin the car and sell it I feel bad for new owners. with all the excessive frame damage because they wanna be cool in parking lots and chase Instagram likes.
Admin is clearly triggered. Must be a hard life 🤷🏻‍♂️ you ok bro? You know the Gov lets you have 10 counselling sessions for free right? Get it off your chest bro. It's okay.

Look, can we just end the fucking bullshit here and now? I'm starting to get over being targeted by these angry admins. Im happy to stop commenting about 20dets or whatever if that's enough to appease the angry mob. This bullshit is honestly getting on my fucking nerves and I'm sick of my shit being posted by this page. I like RB20DETs, they sound wicked and they are a good bang for buck engine. Whatever. Just stop bringing me into this internet clout shit it's really gotten old.
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Supra Boost. The Power is extremely high, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the boost will go out a typical viewer's wastegate. There's also paul walkers nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about JDM. As a consequence people who dislike Supra Boost truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the power in Doms existential catchphrase ""It doesn't matter if you win by an inch or a mile, family is corona"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Hans genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 
A stock Barra can make 1500 horsepower unopened, you only need to touch top end and bigger turbo for easy 2200 horsepower plus figures on street car. LS engine is unreliable V8 layout, Barra is inline 6 very good layout, superb balance. Toyota 2JZ, Nissan RB26 both in-line six, and two best engines ever made. Ford specifically had to restrict power on F6 Typhoon to legally sell it here. LS is outdated platform and Barra outperforms in every way.
Imagine being that much of a low life you have to post about cunts if you wanna be a big boy come and see me you little cunt.
Still dont see the problem with it? So what if everyone uses Simmons. They make good wheels and they look good. You going to not use kinchrome because everyone else does? Going to not put chrome on your Harley because everyone else does? With 8 billion people on the planet, literally everything you do was done by many before you so stop thinking your unique.
Why would you ruin such a nice car like this? Literally I don’t understand the reasoning behind it, you Subaru owners are all the same. Tasteless modifications to such a pristine car, makes me sick to my stomach. Those headlights aren’t period correct either, taking away from what made the car so great in the first place. You also dare still keep the STI logos on the fog covers? This is a disgrace to Subaru Tecnica International and their engineers. You’re literally spitting in their faces, the audacity for you to do that.
A DOHC turbo ls1? You mean a boosted coyote?
but an ls ain't even OHC let alone DOHC
adding det to everything cos you're just learning about engine codes isn't a joke, it just makes you look like a dumb 
admins a dumb cunt, needs to stick to mums Corolla
I couldn’t care less what you think 🤔 these pages are the ugly side of the car scene that everyone hates. You people are a zoo and I hate being associated with you. Me on the other hand am a competitive driver in a competitive car. Keep hating bud 🤣

As a consequence people who dislike Supra Boost truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the power in Doms existential catchphrase ""It doesn't matter if you win by an inch or a mile, family is corona"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Hans genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂
And yes, by the way, i DO have a 2JZ tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

On the Theology of Sex,"Since god is everywhere that technically means that every time two people have sex, it's technically a threesome. And a threesome is really a foursome because god is also there.

However, what this also means is that every time you masturbate, your effectively having normal two-person sex.

So uhh later virgins.😎"

In response to someone saying “Sup Bitches” in their caption,"I genuinely hate it when people say “___bitches” or “Bitches___” or any variation of it. Smh. It’s disrespectful and demeaning to women and it’s not really funny, classy, badass or quirky. Just seems like you had nothing else to caption your photo 🤷🏻‍♀️ not trying to spread hate, just personally don’t appreciate the term or the use of it in a general/broad sense. If you’re literally talking to a female dog, then it is appropriate. Feminists (which I am not) have tried to take the negative stigma away from the term by saying things like “boss bitches” or “bad bitches” but it’s still just as demeaning as it was in the 15th century. I just think as a female on the IG platform, with an extremely large following, you should be more aware of these kind of things. Especially when a good portion of your following are young girls."

"People who post memes -- but don't do dank memes-- are NOT ""memers""","# 📷

If you do memes and have have image macros on facebook for likes, you're just a regular joe whose advice animals are on the internet.

I'm so sorry that I hold the title of ""memer"" to a modicum of professionalism.

If I predict the weather for the next week and upload it to YouTube that doesn't make me a fuckin' meteorologist.

I had a friend in 11th grade highschool that was a danker memer than some of these bitches calling themselves memers. ""I don't do pepe I just have done 250 boring captions for Cowbelly because I have a sense of humor like i'm 16 years old"" is lame af. Get some fucking self respect for yourself and step your games up.

And for fucks sake all you black holers-- work on your deep fry game. You're not exempt from getting better at making memes unreadable because you're subbed to blackholememes. Some Little Spongebob meme is sucking 4"" of a 16"" political statement and the dudes in the tweet's replies are like OMG BEST MEME IN HISTORYYYYYY. Motherfucker what."

STFU Moran,"r/The_Donald isn't racist. We just say it how it is, there's no point sugar coating things. I guess you morans just don't like to hear the truth.  🤷🏻‍♂️

And for fucks sake all you pretty bitches-- work on your head game. You're not exempt from getting better at sucking dick because you're pretty.

uh oh that was a fortnite reference!,"we cant have that because we're real gamers and real gamers dont like mainstream crap 📷 for your punishment im going to have to ban you from my subreddit r/hotfurrysexporn and my discord server. i am going to post this every subreddit i am part of including r/wedontlikefortnite and r/minecraft because minecraft is a clearly superior game to fortnite. i cant believe you could play a game like fortnite and get not bored. my cousin once came over and asked to play fortnite. i beat his ass and told him to never come back. then everyone clapped because they hate fortnite like me. the gunplay isnt even that good either, like why is it called ""assault rifle"" its clearly a SCAR-H battle rifle. i once asked this child at my school if he knew what a SCAR was and he said ""the fortnite gun?"" i said no its a belgian battle rifle, i then proceeded to shoot him in the head with a 12 gauge and everyone clapped the end. thank you for coming to my ted talk, i hate fortnite"

-Obamium out"
ಠ_ಠ,@Joe Mama yeah little kids like you don’t really know what they’re saying the front part of your brain isn’t fully developed. Cmon dude don’t let these comments get to you and be so negative bc it really won’t get you nowhere. Most of the comments you wrote didn’t seem like you were a “good boi” also saying people should kill them self’s is messed up and disgusting because I don’t think you realize how many people actually decide they’ve had enough and end it. I’ve had a couple friends close to doing such a thing but I’m glad they didn’t and that I was able to do something to help them at least a little and well let whoever play whatever they want tbh a lot of people in mostly every game is toxic(although fortnite actually is worse) but some people playing whatever game they play aren’t always like that they just play the game for fun or something. Anyways no hate tho I’m not here for that and also don’t @ me cuz I don’t want to be a part of drama I simply wanted to say a lil sum sum✌️. . .
Just so u know I made 7 of these....,"(Alarm Clock rings...)Ren:(wakes up looks at the clock.) Ren:(Surprised) OH NO IM LATE!😧 (Ren sprints to the bathroom and gets ready.) Narrator:Today is Ren’s first day of Warrior School. And he must get there fast... (Ren hurries down the stairs and out the door.) Mom:Have a good day! Ren:Phew! I made it just in time! 😅 (Ren jumps on the bus. And takes a seat.) ???:Hi! Ren:AHH! You scared me! 😰 ???:sorry... What’s your name? Ren:My name is Ren... What’s yours? Engine:TheGamingEngine! You can call me Engine for short. Ren:Ok! So what do you like to do? Engine:I like to train in my extra time I want to become a really good warrior! Ren:Wow so do I! I hope one day I can be one of the best warriors in the city! Then I can protect this City forever!  Engine:yeah... Bus driver:Alright! Here we are! Engine:see you later I guess... Ren:cya! (Ren walks through the hallway and goes to his locker on the walls there are posters that say vote for vsco on them.)Ren:(thinking) So this is my locker... I better get used to it! (Ren doesn’t notice it but a shadow sneaks past him and leaves the building.)(Ren puts all his stuff in his locker and heads to class.) Grand master Potato:Ahh you must be Ren! Hello! 👋 🤗 
Ren:Hi! Are you the teacher? Potato:😦Yes!😊 Ok class settle down! I want you all to get to know each other now! Ok?🤨 Megumin:HI! My name is Megumin! I love Art Look! (It looks like a tomato with arms and legs and beside it is a koala.)Megumin:Good right! Ren:Yeah I guess... 😳 Megumin:THANK YOU SO MUCH! Eek! I’m so excited! Ren:...😓 Fade_Entity:I’m Fade_Entity I fight for justice! Ren:Wait you fought someone before!😮 Fade_Entity:Um no... Ren:😨  Ren: Hi what’s your name? 😁 ???:Ha what a loser😏 Ren:😡😤😞  Scar:I my name is scar which is funny because I have a scar right here haha! Ren:ok? (Someone runs across the hallway.) Potato:hmm😠 Hey you! Ren:🧐🤨 (Ren follows Potato out he keeps following until Potato stops then he hides behind a wall.) Potato:What are you doing!😠 ???:I was just going to class mister....😰 Potato:You seem pretty old to be going to this school... (pulls out sword.) ???:I’ve never underestimated you Potato. But you still won’t be smarter than me.Potato:Grr 😡 why are you here! To terrorize my students? ???:I’m here to end you and your pathetic village... Potato:I’m not going to let you! (??? Throws fire at potato potato dodges and one part of the school gets lit on fire.) Potato:😡 (Ren then runs up to potato.) Potato:What are you doing here it’s dangerous!  Ren:I can’t let you get hurt! I must protect this village! (Potato suddenly feels something he sees his eyes in Ren’s and he realizes who he truly is.) Potato:I see you for what you are now.. Let’s destroy this guy!

How the universe ended,"""M-m... M""

No one was paying attention in the crossroads of New York as I was giving my speech.

""M-m-mine...""

However, one person was intrigued in what I was saying.

""M-m-m-minecraft...""

Then it was just a domino effect, ten more people are watching.

""Minecraft...""

A hundred were now watching, this had caught the attention of even the busy drivers in rush hour. Their faces in anticipation, some were even scared. Others were complaining that this isn't the real deal.

""MINECRAFT...""

But they all suddenly started cheering, shaking, praying. When they heard my tone, my pitch, my timbre.... they all knew what was going to come next. They realized... that salvation of the human race has finally come.

""Minecraft good Fortnite bad""

And then the silence broke

""OOOIOIIUUUUUGHHHhJJHHHHHWAASEAAAa//::""

Thousands of people fell to their knees, yelling orgasmically. People starting crying tears of joy, others were running and thanking God, News reporters were already on the scene, broadcasting the entire thing nationwide and consequently the entire world. Hundreds of people came out of their cars, buses, taxis, stores, and subway stations hooting and hollering. It was a miracle unfolding.

I started to say the next sentence relayed to me by our Lord and Savior.

""M-m-mi... Mine...""

Already some people fainted at just the mere sound of my voice. Even more people came. Some were jumping from planes thousands of feet in the air, others ran or swam miles to here in mere seconds. I think I even spotted a few famous people.

""MINE...""

Nearly a million people were here now. There's now Europeans, Canadians, Mexicans, Latin Americans, West Coasters, Africans, and even several Asians and one Australian. They were screaming hysterically, bringing gifts for me, taking pictures and videos. Fireworks and confetti everywhere, helicopters, and even Donald Trump was here with his family bowing down to me.

""MINEC-C-C-CRAFT voice crack""

A billion people were here now. Even animals from all over the world were coming in herds. I could see Pewdiepie &amp; Martiza, Elon Musk, Keanu Reeves, Lil Nas X, 50 Cent, Oprah Winfrey, the Kardashians, and so many other people. Many people were having seizures, heart attacks, and strokes from the sheer excitement, and some were being trampled to death because of the huge crowd. The screaming was deafening. Some just came straight out of their bathroom, school, work, or their parenting... but it doesn't matter now.

""MMMMMMIIIIINNNNEEECRAAAFTTTTT""

No matter what was your race, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, economic class, etc... it didn't matter. All of humanity has come together for this one moment. Millions of people have died to due plane crashes, car crashes, doctors abandoning their patients, parents abandoning their children... just to be here, but it will all be worth it.

Nearly half of humanity is here now. Even the dead came out their graves for this. Everyone is climbing on top of each other and on the walls of skyscrapers since they couldn't fit. So many lights, music, dancing, feasts... yet barely a minute passed. Humanity is very interesting.

10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

I look at the smiling faces of the crowd in front of me. I look at the death and destruction that came from sacrifice to attend this event. This is it. We're ready.

0.

""Minecraft good Fortnite bad Instagram normie Emojis bad Keanu breathtaking Wholesome 100 \[Everyone liked that\] Area 51 PETA bad 69 nice 420""

""AaAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAyyyYYYYYYYYYYYyaYayaYaASyAAaYaaYayaAAAaaUGgGHHhHHhhHHhhHHh😩😩👅👄👀🥵🥵mmmmMMMMmMmMMMMMMMMM😭🤯😱😂🤣😍🤪💦hhhhhhHhFFFfffF""

Billions of people around the world disintegrated into their pure chemical compounds that composed their bodies, then their atoms, then their protons/neutrons/electrons, and finally their quarks... as they heard that holy sentence. The distant echoes of yelling can heard from thousands of miles. This... this was their ultimate purpose in life. This is the culmination of everything that has happened in human history, it is reason why life even existed in the first place. They weren't screaming in terror, they were shouting in orgasmic joy. They could finally die happy. Their entire lives flashed before their eyes as they saw their loved ones. They saw their ultimate fantasy. They can finally be freed from their imperfect bodies in this imperfect world.

The Sun blinked out. The Moon crashed into the Earth. The Earth turned into dust. The Solar System collapsed into a state of entropy. The Milky Way hosts a firework show of supernovas. All the galaxies of the universe colliding with one another. Reality is falling apart. That's because reality doesn't need to exist anymore. It has reached its goal. Spacetime has fallen. Matter ceases to exist. Not even the concept of nothing exists. The universe was never born.

Humanity is gone. Everything is gone. We are now one. Evil doesn't exist anymore. Insecurities don't exist anymore. Fear, sadness, anger don't exist anymore. Just hope, love, and harmony for eternity. This is what we were meant to be. This is our final evolution stage.

This is heaven. This is what it means to be happy.

Congratulations."

Grilled Eggplant &amp; Peach Caprese Salad resulting in eggplant bursting and oosing?,"From r/cooking

I've been trying to cook an eggplant and peach dish for my wife because she keeps texting the 🍆🍑 emojis when I've been asking what she wants for dinner. I googled and found a dish to surprise her with for when she comes home tonight, however, I'm getting really frustrated trying to cook it. I've been trying to grill the eggplant and have fully rubbed and seasoned it with salt as the instructions say, however about halfway on the other side the eggplant just burst open with its insides going everywhere. I was wondering if anyone has suggestions on how to avoid this because she's going to be home in a good hour or two and I don't want to let her down before Christmas."

Why pee is stored in the balls,"So I had to look this up: The hydroelectric pulses of the balls and the overclocked production of nut controls the brain signals and reverts the pee back to the brain. Then the brain  will realize what the fuck you just did and transfer the pee into the balls. The pee overtakes the ball and the nut transfers to the nufarium, the gland that stores the nut. If you pee the nufarium sends signals to the pee command centre telling the nut to fill the balls and let out of the pee into the penis. Science fact ☢️🧬🧪😂🤪"

There is a CUM EGG alert in aisle 4!

Someone came all over the floor. There is cumeggs everywhere. You cannot stand in aisle 4 without seeing or feeling cumeggs. The amount of eggs and ejaculate in aisle 4 is simply unnatural. Please for the love of God, we need a cleanup in aisle 4. This lagoon of cummie eggie must have been produced by a fucking blue whale.

Oh God I can smell it.

Turtle Fucker,"
Yeah I fuck turtles... so what?? I’m sexually attracted to turtles and I have nothing to be ashamed about. When I see the jaws on those turtles I just imagine sticking my cock in there getting it gnawed off and it makes me harder than the keratinous shell that protects me from fucking their insides. My fursona name is called Turtle Tom, and all I want to do is make turtle stew inside their guts until they writhe in pain but they can’t roll over. No, no, they’re stuck... stuck in my hellish sexual deviance and they make their little squeals with each thrust I push. They’re in Turtle Tom’s world now😈😈"
A letter to my future wife,"The moment I laid eyes on you my pants 👖 grew a tent bigger than the cirque du soleil. Girl, please love me. I made a playlist on Spotify and even bought a subscription for Apple Music to make a love and sad playlist because I know you don’t have Spotify 😢. I will devote more hours to you than Hitler did to eradicating all non aryans, and that is still an understatement. I know that I’m just a lowly janitor but if you would do me the honor of marrying me I would be elated. We could plan the wedding to happen on the same day as your 13th birthday, I’d say devoting your life to me would be a good birthday gift. But that’s just me. We could go on adventures in my big white ford van with tinted windows. I know it’s not what you have always dreamed about... unless if you have baby 👶 😏. I promise that you will never be disappointed in the sex baby 👶, you are a virgin and I have had sex at least 6000 times with probably 700 women. They have all lead me to you honey 🍯 . Anyways, I’ll be at your place at 1200 sharp be ready with all of your belonging and say goodbye to everyone you know ❤️ 
Yours truly, your future hubby"
High IQ servants of cummy,"Hi😊could you please reed the subreddit name?This is r/copypasta where we post only the most high quality copypastas to be archived and where the comments are of esteemed quality, dissecting and discussing the copypasta in question. (im using big boy words as I went to Harverd so if you can’t keep up with my advanced vocabulary, you now know why fren🤗). Anyways, your coment falls...short of this especialy high standard set by the intelectuals active in this sub and can be considered as cring by most(including me)😬. Please delete and take it to r/cringe where it belongs bud😄(thanks in advance)"
Pure Joy,"So true.  The pure joy is fantastic.

I'm not crying, you're crying.

Edit: downvotes WTF?  I am completely sincere.

Has noone here seen ""I'm not crying you're crying"" before?

If you don't get it, just go away, you're too young to be here because that has been a saying on reddit for a looong time.  If you're just being a jerk, yeah also just go away.

ps edit  I don't give a SHIT about being downvoted.

But I am sick and tired of assholes around reddit who want to f*ck up nice things.

edit 3  Silver, thanks!  😀

edit 4  Santa award, thank you!!

2020,"2020. New year. New me. Literally. Once it hits midnight on December 31st, when it changes to the new year, I have some bad habits I'm going to stop. I'm going to be doing a NO ARTIFICIAL sugar diet, no junk food. Plus, I am going to start working out, and my favorite of all.... I am going to quit smoking cigarettes!!! I'm nervous, and excited! 2020 is going to be the BEST year yet. Just wait an see!! 💝🤙😘"

Shrek was a Nazi operative,"Shrek was a ww2 nazi operative, his disguise as a swap dwelling ogre is only to hide the monstrosities he committed against the Jews. He along was charged with the murder of 27 thousand Jewish children along with stealing all the countries invaded during the wars donkeys and onions. Fiona is also falsely presented as her true name is Fiona Fritz daughter of the late great nazi politician leader Fritz Sauckle. He is charged with 14 counts of tax evasion and 34 counts of unpaid parking tickets, he is also subject to 3 counts of genocide and 2 counts of abuse of power. Free Shrek 😡"
Big mood,"Oh great! Another 2 sentence long pasta! What a game changer! I'm sure the 5 measly lines of text you just posted are going to be the next big copypasta in no time! This is hilarious! Great Stuff! I can really see this being the next big thing! It's gonna be the next ""Navy Seal"" or ""Penguin Of Doom"", I can feel it! I love how short and boring it was! Extra points for being extremely forgettable with no interesting lines, a complete lack of tone, and, as I mentioned earlier, an extremely compact 30 to 40 word length! You know what you should do? You should, unprompted, post this godawful pasta in the comments of a post on a separate subreddit and when people downvote you you can post it to r/AteThePasta! Now that would be funny! Almost as funny as the pasta itself, which, may I remind you, is extremely short! God I can't believe you came up with this all on your own! Thanks so much for this! It's truly a gift! And it made me realise that no matter how hard I try I will never find a copypasta as funny as this roughly 30 word paragraph that has already been forgotten by the 47 people who upvoted it, and the 20 people who commented !thesaurizethis over and over again! And I should give up all hope of coming up with such a great pasta in my life, so I'm simply going to kill myself tonight! This is your fault! Your copypasta made me kill myself! I'm going to write your reddit username in my suicide note, as well as the entire copypasta, which I should have no trouble fitting on the page since it's so fucking short! Thanks again! 😁"

To those people 😡,"To those people 😡 making anti-furry comments 🚫, you know who you are 😤.

This took me awhile to make. Enjoy.,"""SPONGEBOB, ME LAD, YOU HAVE TOO MANY ORIFICES FER YER OWN GOOD🙊. YER GETTIN' A PROMOTION!"" said Mr. Krabs as 🅰️ his hard 🔻red🔻 carapaced 🍆cock🍆 jabbed into the back↩️ of Spongebob's head🗣.

""I feel like 💙💙 I'm absorbing some 👽weird👽 fluid,"" spluttered Spongebob 🅰️s Krabs' nasty crustaceo-jizz poured from his 👄mouth👄, nose🐽 and 👀eyes😙.

""NOW EARN💰 YOUR KEEP, LANDLUBBER,"" said Krabs 🅰️s he grabbed Spongebob by his 💦jizz-soaked💦 trousers and began using him to clean🛁 the floor.

""Oh Mr. Krabs, I-""

""CALL ME MASTER YE 🙊BITCH🙊""

Krabs stepped down🔽 hard in Spongebob and 🅰️ puddle of his own 💦jizz🍆 began spreading radially on🔛🔛 the floor of the Krusty Krab.

""Hurgghbglbgblblgbl.""

""🤮CHOKE🤮 ON IT, YE INVERTEBRATE, OR I CAN'T GET 😩HARRRRRRD😩. THESE CLAWS AREN'T JUST GOOD FER MATIN…OH, WAIT, 😂YES THEY ARE😂,"" said Krabs 🅰️s he caressed his eleventh 🍆leg🍆.

The 💦jizz💦 began floating up🔝 toward the ceiling 🅰️s Krabs brandished his seven7️⃣-inch red 🍆masthead🍆. You have to realize this is to scale, so 🇮🇹it🇮🇹 was about twice his 👅body👅 size.

Anyway, Squidward burst into the room wearing only 🅰️ gimp ♦️suit♦️ and 🅰️ 🙏tutu🙏.

""🙏TAKE ME MASTER🙏, I NEED TO BE 😳HUMILIATED😳,"" he said, 🅰️s his four4️⃣-millimeter 🍆calamari🍆 poked limply from the tight leather.

""TAKE 🍆THIS🍆, THEN,"" said Krabs 🅰️s he jabbed 1️⃣one1️⃣ of his prehensile eyestalks up🆙 Squidward's 💩stankhole🍑. Squidward moaned😩, 🙊rubbing himself🙊 gently with 🕠5🕠 of his tentacles.

""I CAN 👀SEE👀 YOU DON'T TAKE CARE OF YOUR 🍑💩HOLE💩🍑 VERY OFTEN,"" said Krabs. Patrick burst into the room wearing nothing but 🅰️ smile😊 and brandishing 🅰️ towel. 

""DID SOMEBODY CALL THE 🍑HOLE🍑 DOCTOR?""

""Are you 🅰️ real 💉doctor💉?"" asked🙏 Spoogebob🤔.

""I went to community college🎓,"" said Patrick 🅰️s he forcibly yanked out Krabs' eyestalk and shoved 🇮🇹it🇮🇹 in his gay fat 👄mouth👄.

""Hold this open👐, will ya?"" said Patrick 🅰️s he ripped😩 off Spongebob's erect penis and used it🇮🇹 to jam Squidward's hole🍑🕳 open👐👐. It immediately grew💗💗 back⬅️ but smaller and wetter.

""Hmm🤔... there's 🅰️ lot of 💩SHIT💩 in here,"" said Patrick. ""How much fiber is in 🍔Krabby Patties🍔 anyway🤔?""

""YE WOULDN'T BELIEVE,"" said Krabs, 🅰️s 🅰️ gigantic turd💩 stretched😩 his red 🅰️sshole🍑💩 until it🇮🇹 tore😩💦.

""I NEED AN 💦ENEMA💦,"" said Patrick. ""OH WAIT WE'RE UNDERWATER."" Patrick 👄nibbled👄 gently at the tip of Krabs' eyestalk 🅰️s he released it🇮🇹 from his mouth 😺. He wiped eye😍😍 fluid from the corner of his 👅mouth👅 and put Squidward's zippered 🤐 lips💋 to his own.

""ON THE COUNT OF THREE"" said Patrick. ""ONE… TWO… OH FUCK😩 IT HNRRRRRRGGUUUUUUUUUUUUUUH!""

Patrick blew 🍃 Squidward 😍like😍  🅰️ 🎺trumpet🎺. All 🕣8🕣 of his tentacles went rigid😩 and his squidjuice💦 spilled out from the dick hole🕳 in his suit ♠️. The immense force 🆕started🆕 to blow💥 crusty chunks of shit💩💩 out of Squidward's 🍑ass🍑.

""I must keep the Krusty Krab clean 🚿!"" yelled Spoogebob 🅰️s he 😰rushed😰 over and 😃opened😃 his mouth👄. Spongebob recognized bits of the 🍔Krabby Patty🍔 formula🙊 in his 😮mouth😮 🅰️s Squidward's acrid 🍑shit💩 coated his tongue👅 and teeth😬.

""😩SWALLOW😩, YE LANDLUBBER,"" said Krabs, poking his 🍆dick at Spongebob's lips👄.

""HMRGGRGHRGUHF😩,"" said Spongebob, shaking his head💆. He wanted to savor it 🇮🇹, but Krabs had other plans.

Krabs got up🔝 on🔛 his desk and flexed💪. ""GET READY"" he yelled 🅰️s he jumped down ⤵️⤵️ on🔛 Spongebob with 🅰️ stone cold😓 stunner😧. Blood, semen🍆 and shit💩 sprayed💦 powerfully from every one1️⃣ of Spongebob's ⛳️holes ⛳️. The force of the explosion💣 😂tore😂 both of his legs🍗 📴off📴. The assorted fluids💦 and solids coated the walls of Krabs' 📁office📁.

""YE GOT THAT 💩SHIT💩 ALL OVER ME FIRST 💵DOLLAR💵,"" screeched Krabs. ""AND YOU KNOW THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO CLEAN IT!""

Squidward, Patrick and Spongebob all 🙏begged🙏 at Krabs' knees, pleading to be the ones1️⃣ who 🉐got🉐 to lick the moist brown 💳dollar💳. ""THE FIRST ONES WHO CAN FIND SANDY AND SUCK OFF HER FUTA 🍆COCK🍆 GET TO LICK THE 💵DOLLAR💵,"" decreed Krabs, stowing the 💵dollar💵 in his ass🍑 for safekeeping.

The 3️⃣three3️⃣ homos scrambled out of the room and towards the treedome.

ONE HOUR LATER

Spongebob, Patrick and Squidward approached the door of Sandy's tree 🌴 house🏘, not so much 🅰️s 🅰️ an undergarment🙈 between them, and knocked politely on 🔛 the 🔑door🔑.

Sandy didn't respond, so Patrick broke💔 down⤵️ the door🚪 with his erect👀, barrel-like 🍆member🍆.

""SANDY,"" they screamed 😱, not caring🏎 about the lack of water🚱. ""SAAAAAANDY!""

Patrick picked ⛏ up☝️ some mud and smeared it🇮🇹🇮🇹 🔛on🔛 his face😣😣. 

""I'M DIRTY DAN🙈,"" he growled.

""I 🙏hope🙏 Dirty Dan likes👭 getting🉐 RAMMED UP THE 🍑ASS🍑,"" yelled Spongebob, 🅰️s he thrust his supple yellow🌕 cattle🍆 prod🍆 into Patrick's chasmal🙈 pink 🍑rear🍑. Patrick groaned😩 in pleasure😩.

""Who you callin' pinhead🤔?""

""SHUT THE FUCK UP🤬! DIRTY DAN DOESN'T TALK🤬,"" screamed😱 Spongebob 🅰️s he climaxed😩.

Patrick scooped out some of Spongebob's 💦cum💦 from his cavernous brown🙈 crevice🙈 and smeared 🇮🇹it🇮🇹 into Squidward's eyes👀. ""YOU'RE DIRTY DAN!""

""UNGHHHH, 😩IT HURTS SO GOOD😩!"" Squidward smeared the semen into his eyes👀 until they bled. Blood and semen gushed💦 ⏬down⏬ his face💋.

""THIS REMINDS ME OF THAILAND,"" said Spongebob pensively😔, puffing💨 🔛on🔛 his pipe, which he fashioned👗 out of 1️⃣one1️⃣ of his older👴 penises🍆.

Squidward enjoyed what😦 remained of Spongebob's cum🍆💦 🅰️s Spongebob rode the tip of Patrick's 🍆voluminous 🍑horsehitch🍑 into Sandy's room. 

She was 😴sleeping😴, but she looked 👀 like😗 she had 🈶 put on🔛 weight🏋🏋. Her futa 🍆cock🍆 was fully erect🙈.

""🤣LET'S RAPE HER🤣,"" suggested Patrick, peeling Spongebob off📴 his 🍆penis🍆 and throwing him violently against the wall. 

""Wait Patrick, don't you know ANYTHING about 🌰squirrels🌰?"" cautioned🚧 Spongebob, ripping off📴 his damaged 🍆member and growing  🅰️ new 🗞 one1️⃣. He placed the damaged one1️⃣ on🔛 a 🅰️ necklace📿 he was keeping.

""I KNOW THEY'RE EXCELLENT TARGETS FOR RAPE, ESPECIALLY WHILE THEY'RE SLEEPING😴,"" said Patrick 🅰️s he jammed his 🍆holiday yule log🍆 into Sandy's ear👂. She was fast 🚅 asleep and didn't seem to notice, but her cock twitched👀.

""It's called📲 HIBERNATION, Patrick. Squirrels stuff valuable treasures into their 🐚vaginas🐚 and then go to 💤sleep💤 for six 6️⃣ months🈷️.""

""TREASURE? I WANT TREASURE"" 🐅roared 🐅 Patrick 🅰️s he dove🕊 head🗣-first into Sandy's gaping 🐚pussy😩. ""UHH, I'M STUCK. WHERE'S THE TREASURE?""

""GO...DEEPER!😩"" grunted Spongebob, giving Patrick 🅰️ good✨ shove.

""I CAN'T🚫. I'M TOO FAT,"" he replied. ""I'M REALLY HORNY😩 THOUGH👀.""

Spongebob chuckled. His plan had 💼worked💼. Patrick was 😵incapacitated😵 and he was free🆓 to suck off📴 Sandy's futa 🍆cock while she 🌓slept.

""SPONGEBOB🤔? SPONGEBOB, WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT THERE🤔?"" Patrick's muffled voice rang🔗 out from somewhere nearby, but Spongebob was enjoying Sandy's hard, flexible 🍆prick🍆 in his 😦mouth 😦.

Sandy 🗞rolled over and her 🍆dick👀 went through the side of Spongebob's mouth 👅 and out one1️⃣ of his ear👂 holes⛳️. ""COME ON, DAMMIT, WHY WON'T YOU 💦CUM💦?"" muttered Spongebob 🅰️s he moved📦 himself sensually up☝️ and ⤵️down⤵️ the 📏length📏 of Sandy's 🍆anaconda🍆.

At last, the 💤sleeping💤 🌰squirrel 🌰 climaxed, shooting💉 hot🍧 greasy🍆 cum💦 from Spongebob's ear🌾. He pocketed some of it 🇮🇹 because he knew Krabs would require proof, probably while raping😩 him violently😩.

""MMMRH? WHO SUCKED ME OFF💦?"" murred Sandy 🅰️s she rubbed her eyes👀.

""SPONGEBOB, YOU CHEATER!"" yelled Patrick, his voice muffled by the squirrel's🌰 vaginal wall.

Spongebob ran💨 as🅰️ fast⏩ as🅰️ his gay little 🍗legs🍗 would carry him out of Sandy's room. Squidward was attempting to fuck 🅰️ 🎄tree🎄."

Wholesome Minecraft 100,"""M-m... M""

No one was paying attention in the crossroads of New York as I was giving my speech.

""M-m-mine...""

However, one person was intrigued in what I was saying.

""M-m-m-minecraft...""

Then it was just a domino effect, ten more people are watching.

""Minecraft...""

A hundred were now watching, this had caught the attention of even the busy drivers in rush hour. Their faces in anticipation, some were even scared. Others were complaining that this isn't the real deal.

""MINECRAFT...""

But they all suddenly started cheering, shaking, praying. When they heard my tone, my pitch, my timbre.... they all knew what was going to come next. They realized... that salvation of the human race has finally come.

""Minecraft good Fortnite bad""

And then the silence broke

""OOOIOIIUUUUUGHHHhJJHHHHHWAASEAAAa//::""

Thousands of people fell to their knees, yelling orgasmically. People starting crying tears of joy, others were running and thanking God, News reporters were already on the scene, broadcasting the entire thing nationwide and consequently the entire world. Hundreds of people came out of their cars, buses, taxis, stores, and subway stations hooting and hollering. It was a miracle unfolding.

I started to say the next sentence relayed to me by our Lord and Savior.

""M-m-mi... Mine...""

Already some people fainted at just the mere sound of my voice. Even more people came. Some were jumping from planes thousands of feet in the air, others ran or swam miles to here in mere seconds. I think I even spotted a few famous people.

""MINE...""

Nearly a million people were here now. There's now Europeans, Canadians, Mexicans, Latin Americans, West Coasters, Africans, and even several Asians and one Australian. They were screaming hysterically, bringing gifts for me, taking pictures and videos. Fireworks and confetti everywhere, helicopters, and even Donald Trump was here with his family bowing down to me.

""MINEC-C-C-CRAFT voice crack""

A billion people were here now. Even animals from all over the world were coming in herds. I could see Pewdiepie &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Martiza, Elon Musk, Keanu Reeves, Lil Nas X, 50 Cent, Oprah Winfrey, the Kardashians, and so many other people. Many people were having seizures, heart attacks, and strokes from the sheer excitement, and some were being trampled to death because of the huge crowd. The screaming was deafening. Some just came straight out of their bathroom, school, work, or their parenting... but it doesn't matter now.

""MMMMMMIIIIINNNNEEECRAAAFTTTTT""

No matter what was your race, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, economic class, etc... it didn't matter. All of humanity has come together for this one moment. Millions of people have died to due plane crashes, car crashes, doctors abandoning their patients, parents abandoning their children... just to be here, but it will all be worth it.

Nearly half of humanity is here now. Even the dead came out their graves for this. Everyone is climbing on top of each other and on the walls of skyscrapers since they couldn't fit. So many lights, music, dancing, feasts... yet barely a minute passed. Humanity is very interesting.

10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

I look at the smiling faces of the crowd in front of me. I look at the death and destruction that came from sacrifice to attend this event. This is it. We're ready.

""AaAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAyyyYYYYYYYYYYYyaYayaYaASyAAaYaaYayaAAAaaUGgGHHhHHhhHHhhHHh😩😩👅👄👀🥵🥵mmmmMMMMmMmMMMMMMMMM😭🤯😱😂🤣😍🤪💦hhhhhhHhFFFfffF""

Billions of people around the world disintegrated into their pure chemical compounds that composed their bodies, then their atoms, then their protons/neutrons/electrons, and finally their quarks... as they heard that holy sentence. The distant echoes of yelling can heard from thousands of miles. This... this was their ultimate purpose in life. This is the culmination of everything that has happened in human history, it is reason why life even existed in the first place. They weren't screaming in terror, they were shouting in orgasmic joy. They could finally die happy. Their entire lives flashed before their eyes as they saw their loved ones. They saw their ultimate fantasy. They can finally be freed from their imperfect bodies in this imperfect world.

The Sun blinked out. The Moon crashed into the Earth. The Earth turned into dust. The Solar System collapsed into a state of entropy. The Milky Way hosts a firework show of supernovas. All the galaxies of the universe colliding with one another. Reality is falling apart. That's because reality doesn't need to exist anymore. It has reached its goal. Spacetime has fallen. Matter ceases to exist. Not even the concept of nothing exists. The universe was never born.

Humanity is gone. Everything is gone. We are now one. Evil doesn't exist anymore. Insecurities don't exist anymore. Fear, sadness, anger don't exist anymore. Just hope, love, and harmony for eternity. This is what we were meant to be. This is our final evolution stage.

This is heaven. This is what it means to be happy.

""M-m... M""

No one was paying attention in the crossroads of New York as I was giving my speech.

""M-m-mine...""

However, one person was intrigued in what I was saying.

""M-m-m-minecraft...""

Then it was just a domino effect, ten more people are watching.

""Minecraft...""

A hundred were now watching, this had caught the attention of even the busy drivers in rush hour. Their faces in anticipation, some were even scared. Others were complaining that this isn't the real deal.

""MINECRAFT...""

But they all suddenly started cheering, shaking, praying. When they heard my tone, my pitch, my timbre.... they all knew what was going to come next. They realized... that salvation of the human race has finally come.

""Minecraft good Fortnite bad""

And then the silence broke

""OOOIOIIUUUUUGHHHhJJHHHHHWAASEAAAa//::""

Thousands of people fell to their knees, yelling orgasmically. People starting crying tears of joy, others were running and thanking God, News reporters were already on the scene, broadcasting the entire thing nationwide and consequently the entire world. Hundreds of people came out of their cars, buses, taxis, stores, and subway stations hooting and hollering. It was a miracle unfolding.

I started to say the next sentence relayed to me by our Lord and Savior.

""M-m-mi... Mine...""

Already some people fainted at just the mere sound of my voice. Even more people came. Some were jumping from planes thousands of feet in the air, others ran or swam miles to here in mere seconds. I think I even spotted a few famous people.

""MINE...""

Nearly a million people were here now. There's now Europeans, Canadians, Mexicans, Latin Americans, West Coasters, Africans, and even several Asians and one Australian. They were screaming hysterically, bringing gifts for me, taking pictures and videos. Fireworks and confetti everywhere, helicopters, and even Donald Trump was here with his family bowing down to me.

""MINEC-C-C-CRAFT *voice crack*""

A billion people were here now. Even animals from all over the world were coming in herds. I could see Pewdiepie \&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Martiza, Elon Musk, Keanu Reeves, Lil Nas X, 50 Cent, Oprah Winfrey, the Kardashians, and so many other people. Many people were having seizures, heart attacks, and strokes from the sheer excitement, and some were being trampled to death because of the huge crowd. The screaming was deafening. Some just came straight out of their bathroom, school, work, or their parenting... but it doesn't matter now.

""MMMMMMIIIIINNNNEEECRAAAFTTTTT""

No matter what was your race, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, economic class, etc... it didn't matter. All of humanity has come together for this one moment. Millions of people have died to due plane crashes, car crashes, doctors abandoning their patients, parents abandoning their children... just to be here, but it will all be worth it.

Nearly half of humanity is here now. Even the dead came out their graves for this. Everyone is climbing on top of each other and on the walls of skyscrapers since they couldn't fit. So many lights, music, dancing, feasts... yet barely a minute passed. Humanity is very interesting.

10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

I look at the smiling faces of the crowd in front of me. I look at the death and destruction that came from sacrifice to attend this event. This is it. We're ready.

0.

""AaAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAyyyYYYYYYYYYYYyaYayaYaASyAAaYaaYayaAAAaaUGgGHHhHHhhHHhhHHh😩😩👅👄👀🥵🥵mmmmMMMMmMmMMMMMMMMM😭🤯😱😂🤣😍🤪💦hhhhhhHhFFFfffF""

Billions of people around the world disintegrated into their pure chemical compounds that composed their bodies, then their atoms, then their protons/neutrons/electrons, and finally their quarks... as they heard that holy sentence. The distant echoes of yelling can heard from thousands of miles. This... this was their ultimate purpose in life. This is the culmination of everything that has happened in human history, it is reason why life even existed in the first place. They weren't screaming in terror, they were shouting in orgasmic joy. They could finally die happy. Their entire lives flashed before their eyes as they saw their loved ones. They saw their ultimate fantasy. They can finally be freed from their imperfect bodies in this imperfect world.

The Sun blinked out. The Moon crashed into the Earth. The Earth turned into dust. The Solar System collapsed into a state of entropy. The Milky Way hosts a firework show of supernovas. All the galaxies of the universe colliding with one another. Reality is falling apart. That's because reality doesn't need to exist anymore. It has reached its goal. Spacetime has fallen. Matter ceases to exist. Not even the concept of nothing exists. The universe was never born.

Humanity is gone. Everything is gone. We are now one. Evil doesn't exist anymore. Insecurities don't exist anymore. Fear, sadness, anger don't exist anymore. Just hope, love, and harmony for eternity. This is what we were meant to be. This is our final evolution stage.

This is heaven. This is what it means to be happy.

Congratulations."

A untitled Garfield kart review," When my wife left me and took full custody of all 30 of my Iranian children, I almost lost it. I became suicidal, cutting deep into my wrists and wishing the emotional turmoil would end. I opened up my computer and planned to have one last good time before I ended my pain stricken and worthless life. Suddenly, out of no where, a notification popped up on my desktop, a steam gift, I could only wonder what it was. I finally used my last essence of courage and wonder I had left in my battered and bruised body to open it. Garfield Kart emerged on my screen. ♥♥♥♥ it, I might as well have some fun on my last day of measely existence. I downloaded and opened the game. A flash of colour, the amazing sound track, enjoyment. I came to the ephiany that it had not been a worthless journey. I had rediscovered Jesus. No not Jesus, one who is greater than he, the legendary Garfield. I played it for hours on end. Win after Win. My wife came to her senses and realised the sexy alpha male she was missing out on. She came home, all my children in her hands.  


'I miss you' she cried.  


'Eat a ♥♥♥♥ Bethany, I have Garfield now'.  


I slammed the door in that ♥♥♥♥♥es face. I could hear her wail into the cold night air, her cries piercing the air like a gunshot in an inclosed room. She got in the stupid, run down car that she drove, pilling the disgusting fruit of my loins into it. Good, I hope that she died. I returned to my computer to see a notifcation, Garfield Kart. I opened it and it was a direct message with a picture attachment, a fully naked Garfield clad in a silk curtain stared into the camera. The captioning was ,'Hey sexy, if you really love me, you'll put your ♥♥♥♥ in the usb drive, see you soon, x', at first, I was repulsed and confused, but it occured to me, this was the will of the afformentioned higher power. Of Garfield the Great himself. Without further hesitation, I did as I was instructed, it hurt, but it was a required evil. I became sucked into the machine, ♥♥♥♥ first, and arrived in the map 'Cats in the hood', and saw a lone figure crouched on the ground, after closer inspection, I realised they were just short. I walked over and saw the familiar orange fur, and spots, I saw the sly grin spread across his face, he took a step toward me.  
' Hey man, you want some lasanga', he said sexily.  
I ran and embraced him, lifting him off the ground.  
'I love you Garfield',  
'I love you too',  
We stepped off the path and hopped in the Legendary Kart, one seat. Only one/  
'Where am I supossed to sit?' I whinned.  
'Oh, about that, you can just sit on daddys lap' he winked.  
I sat down and felt his raging erection touch the tip of my ♥♥♥. We sped off into the sunset, into a life of wonder and romance.

bee movie,"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. BARRY BENSON: (Barry is picking out a shirt) Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. JANET BENSON: Barry! Breakfast is ready! BARRY: Coming! Hang on a second. (Barry uses his antenna like a phone) Hello? ADAM FLAYMAN: (Through phone) - Barry? BARRY: - Adam? ADAM: - Can you believe this is happening? BARRY: - I can't. I'll pick you up. (Barry flies down the stairs) MARTIN BENSON: Looking sharp. JANET: Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. BARRY: Sorry. I'm excited. MARTIN: Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. JANET: Very proud. (Rubs Barry's hair) BARRY= Ma! I got a thing going here. JANET: - You got lint on your fuzz. BARRY: - Ow! That's me! JANET: - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! (Barry flies out the door) JANET: Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! (Barry drives through the hive,and is waved at by Adam who is reading a newspaper) BARRY== - Hey, Adam. ADAM: - Hey, Barry. (Adam gets in Barry's car) - Is that fuzz gel? BARRY: - A little. Special day, graduation. ADAM: Never thought I'd make it. (Barry pulls away from the house and continues driving) BARRY: Three days grade school, three days high school... ADAM: Those were awkward. BARRY: Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. ADAM== You did come back different. (Barry and Adam pass by Artie, who is jogging) ARTIE: - Hi, Barry! BARRY: - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. ADAM: - Hear about Frankie? BARRY: - Yeah. ADAM== - You going to the funeral? BARRY: - No, I'm not going to his funeral. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. ADAM: I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. (The car does a barrel roll on the loop-shaped bridge and lands on the highway) I love this incorporating an amusement park into our regular day. BARRY: I guess that's why they say we don't need vacations. (Barry parallel parks the car and together they fly over the graduating students) {♬ Playing ""Pomp and Circumstance"" ♬} Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. (Barry and Adam sit down and put on their hats) - Well, Adam, today we are men. ADAM: - We are! BARRY= - Bee-men. =ADAM= - Amen! BARRY AND ADAM: Hallelujah! (Barry and Adam both have a happy spasm) {♬ ""Pomp and Circumstance"" Ends ♬} ANNOUNCER: Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. DEAN BUZZWELL: Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9: 15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! ADAM: Will we pick our job today? (Adam and Barry get into a tour bus) BARRY= I heard it's just orientation. (Tour buses rise out of the ground and the students are automatically loaded into the buses) TOUR GUIDE: Heads up! Here we go. ANNOUNCER: Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. BARRY: - Wonder what it'll be like? ADAM: - A little scary. TOUR GUIDE== Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. Barry: This is it!"

YOU CAN KILL MY KARMA BUT YOU CANT KILL THE TRUTH,"Women aren't meant to be your emotional tampons, YOU BOYS NEED TO UNDERSTAND THIS...Hollywood has foist upon you a fantasy world of fragility and it's the work of the Devil himself. There's an order to things: God &gt; man &gt; women &gt; children &gt; dogs. Any disruption to that order results in chaos.

&gt;Likewise, husbands, live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel, since they are heirs with you of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered.

I wanna teach 🎓 kids 👦 the Christian truth ✝️💡

If you wanna reach 🙏 those kids 👦 on the street 🚗

Then you gotta do a rap 🗣 to a hip-hop 🎤 beat 🤜😫

I gave my sermon ✝️ an urban 🏙 kick 🦵

My rhymes 🗣 are fly 🆒, my beats 🤜😫 are sick 🤢

My crew is big ♾ and it keeps getting bigger 💹

I preach ✝️ the word 📖, that's my gig 😀

And I rhyme 🗣 better than Notorious 😡 BIG ♾

Other emcees 💿, I wish them well

But if you live in sin👿, you burn in hell 👿🔥

Now I'ma pass 🔄 the mic 🎙 to my lovely ❤️ wife 👩

She's a fly 😎 emcee 💿 and the light 🌞 of my life ❤️

So to bust 💔 a rhyme 🗣 without further ado

Take it away ⬅️, Mary Sue! 👩

Jesus Christ 😇 is my brutha👱🏿‍♂️

He's the son 👦 of the original G🔫👱🏿‍♂️🚬

And he was sent to Earth 🌎 to elucidate❓the way that we should be

Like if another MC 💿 says 🗣

I don't get mad 😡 and I don't critique ☝️

What’s your sexual fantasy?,"Mine is having a smelly, unhygienic lactose intolerant girl sit on my face all night watching Netflix or playing video games while gorging herself with all manner of dairy and unloading all her rancid farts down my throat. She would also piss down my throat as needed and use me to orgasm as she pleases, before she takes a massive shit in my mouth and makes me eat all of it. 😎"
I sexually identify my penis as a cactus.,"I sexually identify my penis as a cactus. I leave my pubic hair 1/2 inches long so that it will become prickly like a real cactus should be. Id sit outside with no pants on so that my penis can photosynthesis in the blazing hot sun, while i force myself to do it dehydrated cus we cactus 🌵 rarely ever get any rain water. My doctor says that the black dots on my dick are skin cancer, but hes just jealous and cant accept the fact of how awesome of a cactus i am. From now on I want you to call my penis a Cactus and respect my right to be with my cactus brethren at the local garden store pant less. If you can’t accept me and call the cops to have me removed from the garden store, then you’re an cactusphobe and need to check your plantae privilege. Thank you for being so understanding."

There is a CUM EGG alert in aisle 4!

Someone came all over the floor. There is cumeggs everywhere. You cannot stand in aisle 4 without seeing or feeling cumeggs. The amount of eggs and ejaculate in aisle 4 is simply unnatural. Please for the love of God, we need a cleanup in aisle 4. This lagoon of cummie eggie must have been produced by a fucking blue whale.

Oh God I can smell it.

The fluid mixture has invaded my nostrils. There is so much cummie eggy mess. I cannot see. It's all yellow white . Everything. White. Yellow. Mom please help. SOS. Someone call 911, or 411, or a scientist I don't know. I'm_

This is for you hjk,"(staff app)What is your IGN? My IGN is Elegical, it was previously Decessions.  What is your age? I am 14.  What is your Discord? My discord tag is Elegical#4510.  What is your Timezone? I am in Greenwich Meantime or the UK timezone.  Have you ever been staff on ByteMC (Yes/No)? I've never been staff on ByteMC.  How many hours \[weekly\] are you planning to put into ByteMC? Depending on whether I have school or not. On school weeks, I can put in around 21-25 hours weekly. On a non-school week, I can be on most of the day, every day.  When did you first join ByteMC? I first joined at around June 2018, when Generzon and Char first made their videos on ByteMC.  Why are you applying to ByteMC? This server means the world to me. The community is so supportive and has helped me get through a hard time. Most days, logging on the ByteMC and seeing the welcoming greeting really warms me. So, I've decided I want to give back to the community. Furthermore, I want to be a figure that can be someone that can help others, and help them share the love I have for ByteMC. Finally, I can see that sometimes, the staff team gets very busy and stressed/overwhelmed, so I want to help take the pressure from the shoulders of the higher ranks.What previous staff experience do you have? I was a moderator on a Factions server (PrimitveMC) which averaged at around 10-15 players before its recent shutdown. I have also been a moderator for multiple discord servers, highest being around 5k members. Additionally, I have helped run many Realms servers, which may not be similar to the Skyblock/ Prison, but it still taught me how to deal with players, and most importantly, leadership.  What makes you different from other applicants? I'm different from the other applicants because of my experience in moderation, and overall, Minecraft it's self. Another good trait about me is my dedication to getting the task done, no matter what. A massive feature in my character is my respect/care for my peers, and our players.  What would you do to make the server a more enjoyable experience? I can be there for people in need, as well (because of my knowledge and experience in ByteMC, as helping them with any queries they have about the server in general!  Would you like to add anything else?  My name is Zane Miller, and thank you for reading my application to be staff on your server 📷"

SHUT 😏 UP👆 MILLENNIAL 🤣,"I own 2 2️⃣ LLCs (technically 3), make around $200k a year, was born 🐣🐣 in the dirt, and worked my sorry 💔💔💔 ass 🍑 off 80 hour work 💼💼💼 weeks for a very long time ⌚⌚⌚ to get 🉐🉐🉐 there. While I was working 🏗🏗🏗 my ass 🍑 off on 🔛 my product in my free 🆓 time ⌚⌚, outside of my 9-5 hours, people 👫👫👫 like 😄😄😄 you were playing video 📼 games. And now that I put all that blood 💉💉 and sweat 😅😅 into the product and reaped my reward, you want 😋 to come in, call me “rich”, and say 🗣🗣 I’m “exploiting you” because I make more ➕➕➕ money 🤑. If that incentive wasn’t there, I never ❌ would have 🈶 worked those hours to make that product. It never ❌ would have 🈶 been made."
