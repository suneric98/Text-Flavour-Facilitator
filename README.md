# Text-Flavour-Facilitator

## Authors: Eric Sun, Nathaniel Taylor

This is a personal project. Our goal is to add emojis to text to make it more
"flavorful" and more human interpretable. This project is built using pytorch,
and data is collected from reddit's r/copypasta

### Libraries Required:

+ emoji
+ torch
+ gensim
